Research interests
My research focuses on risk factors associated with the development of affective disorders and other forms of psychopathology, using a multidisciplinary approach aimed at understanding the complex interactions between biological and psychosocial factors during development. Key areas of interest include the study of stressful life events, hormones (i.e. hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response), oxytocin (a peptide important in social behaviour), and cognitive-emotional mechanisms of self-regulation.
Current projects include an ongoing longitudinal high-risk study of the offspring of parents with bipolar disorder, studies focusing on emotional information processing and its relationship to depression and poor interpersonal functioning, and laboratory-based studies of stress and psychophysiology.
I am the recipient of a
in Developmental Psychopathology. The research is supported by grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
