The second purpose is to examine the three principal foci of qualitative research in the area: a. schools and their relations with the socio-cultural milieu in which they exist; b. the description and analysis of classroom processes; c. the study of individual pupils and educators. The third purpose is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of studies focusing on these areas. This includes describing and discussing some of the systematic methodological biases apparent in the literature and suggesting directions for future research.
ESTU 614 Social Psychological Foundations of Education
The course provides a basic understanding of the ways in which psychologists examine and analyze human behaviour, collect and interpret data, develop theories and form generalizations. It is not intended as a general survey course in the area of educational psychology. Several topics in an area will be studied in order to exemplify the methods and techniques employed in the psychological analysis of behaviour in educational settings.
ESTU 615 Introduction to Research in Education
By providing an overview of the commonly used research methods in education today, students gain the knowledge required to critique research that is reported in the education and social science literature. Topics include the nature of educational research, the different qualitative and quantitative research approaches, types of data collection, and knowledge of research ethics. Students gain experience in developing a research statement and writing a research proposal.
ESTU 635 Studies in Educational Change
This course is concerned with the investigation and comparison of problems of education in the context of time and society. Concentrating on concrete “case studies” chosen from the 19th century and the contemporary period, it focuses on the principles on which systems of education are constructed, and their change or retention, in the broad socio-economic and ideological context.
ESTU 644 School and Society
This course is concerned with the family, the educational system, the economy and the polity, and with the relations between them. The main concern is with social institutions and the socialization process with which they are involved. Particular emphasis will be placed on the social class differentials in the conditions of socialization and educational opportunity, and on social class differentials in educational achievement.
ESTU 670 Adult Education as a Field of Study
This course is designed as a survey at an advanced level, of the theory and practice of adult education through an examination of the existing literature. Emphasis will be placed on helping the student gain knowledge, understanding, and a critical perspective of the following: aims; history and philosophy; needs and characteristics of adult learners; functions and skills of adult education practitioners; settings, agencies and program areas; and planning and evaluation in adult education. A Canadian and Quebec perspective will be emphasized.
