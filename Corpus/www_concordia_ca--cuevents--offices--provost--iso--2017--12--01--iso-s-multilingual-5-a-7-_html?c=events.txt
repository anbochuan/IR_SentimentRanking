Multilingual 5 a 7!
December 1, 2017, 5 p.m. – 8 p.m.
Come practice French, English, Spanish and more at CSEA's and ISO's monthly language exchange! All language levels are accepted.
How it works: At the CSU small lounge (Hall Building, 7th floor), each language group will be assigned a table. Just choose the table where people are practicing the language you would like to improve, or to help others improve a language you already master!
All we ask is for you to be friendly, patient and respectful towards other participants. There will also be drinks (non-alcoholic) and food!
