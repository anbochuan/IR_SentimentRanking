Engineering and Computer Science Programs
Degrees
Proficiency in English
Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
In addition to the general admission requirements, the Faculty may require applicants to write the Engineering Writing Test (EWT) as a condition of admission to all graduate programs in Engineering and Computer Science. Depending on the result, students may be required to complete remedial English language courses in addition to their program requirements.
Engineering Writing Test (EWT)
The Engineering Writing Test examines students’ ability to provide reasoned assessment of a short technical composition in English or French, and their ability to provide a qualitative account of quantitative or graphically presented data. The test is offered a number of times throughout the year. Based on their performance in the test, students may be asked to take remedial courses.
Academic Regulations
All students registered in a Faculty graduate degree program are assessed at the end of each academic term. This assessment is based on:
courses for which a grade point value has been assigned subsequent to their admission to their program, or in the case of reinstated students, subsequent to their reinstatement, and
other degree requirements, for which no grade point value is assigned, such as doctoral seminars, comprehensive examinations, doctoral research proposals and theses which are graded on a pass/fail or equivalent basis.
Standings of students are determined as follows:
Academic Standing. Please refer to the  section of the Calendar for a detailed review of the Academic Regulations.
Program Specific Requirements. PhD program: Students must obtain an assessment grade point average (AGPA) of 3.00 based on a minimum of 8 credits. A maximum of one grade below B is permitted.
Graduation Requirements. To be considered for the award of a graduate degree, students must have satisfied all degree requirements and have obtained a cummulative grade point average of 3.00 based on all courses credited towards the degree and taken at Concordia subsequent to first registration in the program, and, in the case of PhD students, a maximum of one grade below B.
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy
The Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy program leads to the highest degree offered by the Faculty and is designed to provide students an opportunity to obtain the greatest possible expertise in their chosen field through intensive research. Advancement of analytical and/or experimental knowledge through a combination of specialized courses and a research thesis under the supervision of an experienced researcher forms the main component of the doctoral programs. Where possible, research of interest to industry is encouraged. The objectives of the PhD program is to educate highly qualified researchers required for the expansion of fundamental knowledge and technological innovation through research and development, as well as the needs of institutions of higher learning.
Admission Requirements. To be considered for admission on a full-time basis, applicants normally must hold a master’s degree or equivalent with high standing in engineering or computer science, or in a cognate discipline. Holders of a bachelor’s degree will, in general, be considered for admission to a master’s program only. After completion of a minimum of two terms of full-time study, they may, upon application, be considered by the Faculty Graduate Studies Committee for admission to a PhD program.
To be considered for admission on a part-time basis, applicants must hold a master’s degree with high standing in engineering, computer science or a cognate discipline. Applicants should understand that admission is contingent not only upon a superior academic record, but also on the availability of a research supervisor, of relevant programs of study and research, as well as adequate laboratory and library facilities. Where applicable, an ability to write programs in a standard computer language will be assumed. Students lacking this skill will be required to register for appropriate courses.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate entering the doctoral program with a master’s degree is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits. A candidate admitted beyond the bachelor’s level is required to complete a minimum of 106 credits. Candidates admitted with a master’s degree in a cognate discipline, or if they need additional knowledge in an area pertinent to their research, will, in general, be required to complete more than the minimum number of credits. Students may not credit any undergraduate equivalent course towards the requirements of a 90-credit or 106-credit PhD program without the permission of their supervisor and of the Graduate Program Director.
Residence. For candidates admitted with a master’s degree, the minimum period of residence is two years of full-time study or the equivalent in part-time study. Part-time students may be required by the Faculty Graduate Studies Committee, upon the recommendation of the supervisory committee, to carry out a portion of their research on a full-time basis. Where a candidate has been admitted with a bachelor’s degree, the minimum period of residence is 36 months of full-time study after completion of the bachelor’s degree.
Transfer Credits. Students may be granted transfer credit for courses taken in approved graduate studies prior to their entry into their program. A course submitted for transfer credit must be appropriate to the student’s program of study at Concordia University. An application for such credit will be considered only at the time of admission.
Courses. Students admitted on the basis of a master’s degree will normally be required to complete a minimum of 12 credits in course work. A student admitted on the basis of a bachelor’s degree will normally be required to complete a minimum of 28 credits in course work. Students must also successfully complete the PhD seminar ENCS 8011 (2 credits). Each student’s program must be approved by a supervisory committee consisting of three members of faculty, including the student’s research supervisor. This supervisory committee will also arrange for the student’s comprehensive examination, the presentation of the doctoral research proposal, and thesis evaluation.
Comprehensive Examination. Students must take a comprehensive examination, ENCS 8501, which may be both written and oral. Normally the comprehensive examination is taken when course work has been completed and within 12 (24) months after the first registration as a full-time (part-time) student in a PhD program. Students will be assessed on the basis of written and oral examinations of fundamentals related to their field of research. The comprehensive examination will normally be administered by a committee (the Comprehensive Examination Committee) consisting of the supervisory committee, at least one member external to the candidate’s program and other members appointed at the discretion of the supervisory committee. Students who fail this examination are permitted to take it a second time in the following term. Students failing a second time are withdrawn from the program. Students should consult the program regarding specific examination procedures and requirements.
Doctoral Research Proposal. Upon successful completion of the comprehensive examination, students must pass the doctoral research proposal ENCS 8511 (6 credits), within 18 (36) months after the first registration as a full-time (part-time) student in a PhD program, before they are admitted to candidacy for the PhD degree. Students will be assessed on the basis of written and oral presentations that must include: (i) a critical review of previous work relevant to the subject of the thesis, and (ii) a detailed research plan of action and expected milestones. Students are required to defend their doctoral research proposal before a committee that will normally be comprised of the same members as the Comprehensive Examination Committee. Students must demonstrate the viability of their project and their capacity to undertake doctoral thesis research. The proposal may be accepted, returned for modifications, or rejected. The rejection of a proposal will result in the student’s withdrawal from the program. A student whose proposal is accepted will be admitted to candidacy for the PhD.
Thesis. Students are required to plan and carry out a suitable research, development, or design project, which leads to an advance in knowledge. The student must submit a thesis based upon this work and defend it in an oral examination. For purposes of registration, this work will be designated ENGR 8911 or COMP 8901: Doctoral Research and Thesis (70 credits) or SOEN 8901: Doctoral Research and Thesis (70 credits). Theses will be examined by a committee consisting of the student’s supervisory committee, an external examiner, and other examiners as approved by the Faculty Graduate Studies Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies.
Cross-Registration. A student in the program wishing to take courses under the cross-registration scheme must first obtain approval of the Faculty Graduate Studies Committee. (See Inter-University Agreement in
