Through exhibitions, publications, and events the gallery makes public the work of Concordia faculty, students, alumni, and staff. The Gallery also presents work from beyond the university community when it relates to the research and pedagogical aims of the Faculty. A space dedicated to innovation, the Gallery fosters and facilitates training opportunities, pedagogical inquiries, and curatorial experiments.
