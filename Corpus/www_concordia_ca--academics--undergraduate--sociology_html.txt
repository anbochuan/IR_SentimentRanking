Why study Sociology?
We're social creatures. We live and die as members of — and contributors to — a society. As sociologists, we look at how societies are constituted in Canada and across cultures. As a student, you learn methods to systematically observe, investigate and analyze societies. You also think critically about social problems and social change.
Whether you study the self and identity or conduct large-scale research projects, our courses give you the opportunity to apply social science methods to nearly any situation: human rights, gender and sexuality, crime and justice, conflict and power, regional studies, even cyberspace.
While you study human behaviour, social interaction and organizational patterns, you also study the theory and process of social change, enhancing your thinking about the reasons for poverty, prejudice and other social problems.
Sociology’s many perspectives and methodological approaches will prepare you to make positive and effective social change in our society, or around the world.
Program Details
A Bachelor of Arts degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, .
Concentrations:
Honours in Sociology (60 credits)
The Honours program is a package of courses designed to ensure the highest quality learning experience for anthropology and sociology students. It includes courses that provide strong theoretical and methodological training with those that give students ‘hands-on’ experience conducting sociological and anthropological investigation and research. The program culminates in the Honours seminar (Soci 409) in which students are given the opportunity to conduct research from beginning to end — from the formulation of a topic to its investigation, analysis, and communication — all within a supportive and stimulating environment. Successful completion of this program will provide you with formal skills and credentials that will make you competitive in academic, public, and private sectors and an informal experience that will support your career and aspirations for the future.
