Intro to soldering
Speaker: Tina Salameh, Technology Analyst, Concordia University Library
In this 3-hour-long workshop, we will teach you everything you need to know about soldering to take your upcoming electronics project from the breadboard to the real world. We will learn about the tools of the
trade and the techniques that will make your soldering solid and reliable.
By the end of our workshop you will have built one or two fun projects you can take home, and we will show you where you can go from there!
Open to everyone. 180 minutes.

3D modelling 102: OpenSCAD
Speaker: Sean Cooney, Technology Sandbox Technician, Concordia University Library
So you want to model things in 3D (be it for 3D printing, digital art, blueprints, or for video-game content), but you’re unfamiliar with how to do it or the software you’re using doesn’t give you the fine control you need? Come to our workshop. OpenSCAD is free, open-source software for detailed, programmatically defined, primitive based rendering software. If that sounds complicated, you will be pleasantly surprised at how easy and intuitive the software is once you get started. Please bring a laptop you can install software on.
Open to everyone. 120 minutes.
Thursday, November 9, 2 - 4 p.m.
Webster Library, LB-205
Intro to Linux
Speaker: Sean Cooney, Technology Sandbox Technician, Concordia University Library
Have you heard of Linux and want to know more, or you haven’t heard of Linux but the words “free operating system” spark your interest?
Maybe you already know a little bit about Linux and want to learn the basics of how to use it; everyone is welcome at our Intro to Linux workshop!
In this workshop we’ll cover a bit of background of who, what, when, and why, and then go into some details on the ways in which using the operating system differs from Mac and Windows.
Raspberry Pi computers for using and experimenting with Linux will be provided.
Tuesday, November 14, 2 - 4 p.m.
Webster Library, LB-205
Intro to Sketchup
Speaker: Ruolin Wang, Technology Sandbox Assistant, Concordia University Library
Sketchup is a popular 3D modeling software which has a wide range of uses in architectural design, interior design, civil and mechanical engineering. Compared to other 3D modeling software, Sketchup is easily to learn and supported by a friendly interface. Compelling walkthroughs, house staining and detailed models can be created in this software; Sketchup files can also be exported to other simulation software, such as Energy Plus, Wufi, Transys and others.
This workshop will get you started on the right foot with Sketchup! We will look at basic commands to model the interior and exterior of buildings, and model a quick example. Finally we will look at some useful Sketchup plugins, for example one plugin makes it simple to 3D print your creation.
Please bring a laptop with Sketchup installed on it. You can install Sketchup beforehand (30-day trial) using this link:
Friday, November 17, 1 - 3 p.m.
Webster Library, LB-205
Sticker time
Speaker: Jasia Stuart, Technology Analyst, Concordia University Library
This intro will walk you through the basics of using vector graphics. You'll then print your design as a small vinyl decal (cut-out sticker).
Bonus: the digital die cutting machine can also draw and cut paper; time allowing we will demonstrate these features. Bring your laptop or sign one out from the Loans & Returns desk.
Open to everyone. 120 minutes.
Tuesday, November 21, 2 - 4 p.m.

Hyperbolic Space Crochet
Speakers: Kathleen Botter, Systems Librarian & Jasia Stuart, Technology Analyst, Concordia University Library
This is nerdy-math-crafting like you have never seen it before!
Drop by the Technology Sandbox in November to learn how to crochet a model of hyperbolic space. This is nerdy-math-crafting like you have never seen it before! Warning: other mathematical models may also be explored, and you may leave with a greater appreciation for the connection between textiles and computing. We will teach you a little bit about hyperbolic space and the basic crochet stitches to get started.
Basic supplies provided and no prior crochet or math skills required!
Drop by from 2 - 3:30 p.m. on November 7-10, 13-14, or 16-17 to get expert assistance with your project.
