AWARDS & FUNDING
How will you pay for tuition?Concordia gives out over 1,700 awards totalling more than $15 million. These include generous scholarships, financial support for conference and travel, as well as incentives to graduate sooner.
For prospective students
Provincial & federal awards
The Quebec and Canadian governments offer a number of competitive graduate scholarships. We encourage you to apply for these awards at the same time you are preparing your application.
Entrance scholarship
Students are automatically considered for all entrance graduate awards when they apply to Concordia, provided they meet eligibility criteria. No separate application is required.
Special Entrance AwardNewly admitted students already benefiting from provincial and/or federal funding are offered a Special Entrance Award valued at $6,000 for master's and $10,000 for doctoral students.
For current students
Provincial & federal awards
Numerous government agencies offer graduate scholarships and postdoctoral fellowships on an annual basis. These include the prestigious Trudeau and Vanier scholarships.
Conference & Exposition awards
Doctoral students can travel anywhere in the world and receive funding of up to $15,000 total while registered in their program. Master's students can benefit from conference funding too.
Graduate sooner
Hard work is rewarded. In 2016, more than 70 Doctoral students were awarded an Accelerator Award of $5,000 so they could focus on writing their thesis and graduate sooner.
For international students only
