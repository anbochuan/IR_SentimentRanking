Brazen Young Alumni Online Networking
Connect with other Concordians from across Canada and the United States
November 29, 2017, 12 p.m. – 1 p.m.
At this one-hour online event, you'll be able to chat with alumni who live in six cities in Canada and the US — without ever leaving your desk!
Wednesday, November 29, 2017
12 – 1 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time
Check into a booth for Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, or New York. You'll be assigned someone from that city and you'll have 10 minutes to chat and network.
Once your 10 minutes are up, you can start a new conversation in any of the booths!
