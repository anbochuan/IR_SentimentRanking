MFSC Breakfast - Disconnect to Reconnect
November 29, 2017, 10:30 a.m. – 11:30 a.m.
How does this sound: Enjoy a delicious free breakfast, meet new people, and our cell phones are off! Let’s talk about how our cell phone habits enable or disable us to have meaningful relationships! Give it a try and see what it’s like.
As usual, halal, kosher or vegan food will be available.
