Why study Actuarial Mathematics?
Actuaries use their mathematical and statistical wizardry to solve problems involving risk and uncertainty. This degree prepares you for actuarial work in insurance, with pension consulting firms, investment banks and in other areas of the financial sector.
Students in the program:
Receive a thorough grounding in mathematics, statistics and probability
Learn models to analyze and solve financial problems involving uncertainty
Learn about computer science, accounting, finance and economics
Take a broad approach to actuarial problem-solving by taking social sciences and humanities courses
Our programs are provisionally accredited by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA). Grads gain exemptions from four of the preliminary professional exams of the Society of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society. Concordia University is designated as a Centre of Actuarial Excellence by the Society of Actuaries.
