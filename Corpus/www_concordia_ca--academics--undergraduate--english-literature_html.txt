Why study English Literature?
Immerse yourself in the words of past poets or contemporary thinkers. With every turn of the page, you have the opportunity to imagine and reflect on lives and worlds different from your own experience, and challenge your assumptions about the meaning of morality and the world from new and unanticipated perspectives. When you study literature, you develop a cultural vocabulary that examines the human condition through history, philosophy and many literary modes from tragedy to satire. It goes without saying that, as a literature student, you'll sharpen your abilities as a critical reader, thinker and writer.
In a curriculum that stretches through time and spans the globe, you will study texts ranging from Old and Middle English to contemporary post-colonial voices from around the world. You'll also study literary theories and models of interpretation, and develop indispensable communication, research, analytic, and rhetorical skills.
After graduation, you will leave with the knowledge and skill for any career that values critical thinking and superior communication skills.
