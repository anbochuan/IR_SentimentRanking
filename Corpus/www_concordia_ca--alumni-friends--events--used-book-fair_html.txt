Concordia Used Book Fair
CONCORDIA USED BOOK FAIRSecond-hand books to support first-rate students!
2017 Concordia Used Book Fair: October 1–3
A hit every year, the Concordia Used Book Fair raised more than $15,000 in 2016, and over $175,000 since its inception 21 years ago.
All proceeds go to Concordia student scholarships and the Multi-faith and Spirituality Centre’s Student Emergency and Food Fund.
The book fair engages teams from across Concordia, including Distribution and Transportation Services, Hospitality Concordia and Security. About 75 additional people volunteer, many of them students, including members of the Concordia Stingers men’s rugby team.
