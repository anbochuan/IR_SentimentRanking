PUBLIC SCHOLARSThey engage with our wider community to share the significance of their emerging research.
The Public Scholars program was developed in partnership with the Montreal Gazette to showcase the value that our doctoral students bring to our city and our world. Ten highly qualified PhD students selected across our four faculties have been prepared to connect and share their knowledge with the wider community. See them in action and follow the conversation on Twitter .
Our Public Scholars will actively share their knowledge with the wider community.
