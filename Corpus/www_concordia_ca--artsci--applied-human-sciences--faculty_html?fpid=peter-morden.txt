Dr. Morden has been a full-time faculty member at Concordia since July, 2003. Over the past two decades Dr. Morden has interspersed academic training in leisure studies and employment within municipal, not-for-profit, and commercial leisure services. Over this time he has developed a profound interest in community efforts to serve the leisure needs of adolescents, ethnocultural communities, and impoverished populations as well as the psychological outcomes of leisure participation. Dr. Morden has published in diverse areas including the psychological antecedents of leisure satisfaction, leisure behaviour and ethnocultural identity development, and leisure policy and practice in Quebec. He has presented at both national and international conferences and has received numerous awards for his scholarship and contributions to the scholarly community.
