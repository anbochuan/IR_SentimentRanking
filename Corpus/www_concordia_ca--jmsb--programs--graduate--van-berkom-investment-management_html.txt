Van Berkom Investment Management Program
Van Berkom Investment Management Program
A $1 million donation by alumnus J. Sebastian van Berkom will establish the Van Berkom Investment Management Program, where eight students per year manage a portfolio of small capitalized North American equities with a view to achieving above-average returns.
Why give to his alma mater? “It’s pretty simple. Sir George accepted me as a student and I’ve done tremendously well ever since. There’s only a certain amount of money one needs in life. After that, I believe in giving back to society,” says van Berkom.
This two-year program targets Bachelor of Commerce or Administration, MBA, MSc in Finance, EMBA, MBA with complete CFA® integration, PhD -Finance and CPA candidates during their first year of schooling.
