Research interests
I am a High Energy Theorist and I work in the general area of Electroweak Theory/Beyond The Standard Model phenomenology.
My main areas of interest in research are:
Supersymmetry, Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and Beyond, with particular emphasis on U'(1) models and the Left-Right Supersymmetric Model.
Precision Tests of Physics Beyond the Standard Model, especially CP violation and Flavor Violation (lepton flavor violation, electric dipole moments, top FCNC decays).
Spontaneous symmetry violation (in particular the connection between R parity and CP).
Theories with Warped Extra Dimensions and their consequences at colliders.
Dark Matter candidates in supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models (relic density, direct and indirect detection experiments, collider signals).
LHC phenomenology: Higgs and top production and decays, extra gauge bosons, exotic particles and their consequences.
At present, I have active collaborations with high energy theorists in Montreal, Finland, France and India.
