Why study Spanish?
Language is the primary medium of human culture and expression. Our programs in Spanish open doors to new ways of understanding the world through the study of language, culture and literature. You will delve into the language of Cervantes, Lorca, Garcia Marquez and Almodóvar and explore one of the world’s most widely spoken languages.
Starting from the four basic language skills — speaking, listening, reading and writing — our programs integrate innovative approaches to the study of Spanish and expose students to a diversity of related aspects such as language, translation, culture and literature.
