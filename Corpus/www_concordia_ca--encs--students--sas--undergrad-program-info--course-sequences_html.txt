Course sequences
Course sequences
Students accepted to Engineering programs, who have completed all required prerequisites, follow a sequence that would lead to graduation after four years (8 terms) of study. ENCS students must follow the sequence of their programs.
If you register for your related sections you should have no time conflicts or problems with your courses. All students in Engineering programs are reminded that they must complete all 200-level courses in their programs prior to commencing courses at the 400-level.
Course sequences by program
Part-time students should take the evening courses specified below for the current year.
Building, Civil, Industrial and Mechanical Engineering - ENGR 213, ENGR 242
Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering - ENGR 213 ELEC 273
Students wishing to work at a somewhat faster pace should consult their departmental Advisor or Student Academic Services for advice on course selection. The maximum load per term for part-time students is eleven (11) credits. Upon completion of all 200-level courses, it is strongly recommended that students studying part-time consider transferring to full-time status, to allow them to complete 12-15 credits per term.
Students accepted to the ECP or MEP program who study on a full-time basis will normally complete their degree after five years (10 terms) of study. Extended Credit and Mature Entry students are required to complete all prerequisites before commencing the regular Engineering sequence in their department.
Please review the mature entry extended credit first year course sequence for  or computer science students.
An option is a grouping of courses within an Engineering program that allows you to obtain more in depth knowledge in a particular field. Courses in the option are usually taken in your last year or two of studies. For example, in Computer Engineering students may choose from System Hardware Option or System Software Option. Students in Mechanical Engineering may choose from options in Thermo Fluid and Propulsion, Design and Manufacturing, Mechatronics and Control Systems or Aerospace and Vehicle systems.
Options are declared within a student’s department, usually in their third year of study. In the case of students in Electrical and Computer Engineering however options are declared at the end of a student’s first year. To find out more about the options available in your program and when your option should be declared, please consult the program descriptions.
