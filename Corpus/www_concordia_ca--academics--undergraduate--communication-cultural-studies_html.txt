Communication and Cultural Studies (BA)
Communication and Cultural Studies (BA)
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Offered by:

Why choose Communication and Cultural Studies?
Dive beneath the surface of the stories we hear and tell ourselves in our culture to discover the way meaning is made. Students will examine cultural messages with a critical eye that doesn't miss the nuances of a profoundly complex society. You'll learn to "read" and analyze the meaning manufactured by everything from what Justin Bieber's wearing to how the newscast is put together. Developing a cultural vocabulary will allow you to engage with the modern media environment critically, and interpret the political and ideological orientations of the messages we consume.
The Major in Communication and Cultural Studies is excellent preparation for graduate studies in either subject. Our students go on to careers in the media, advertising, and public relations or any field where superior analytic and rhetorical skills are valued.

Approximately 160 students are admitted to our undergraduate programs each year — 130 to the degrees in Communication Studies and 30 to the major in Communication and Cultural Studies. The number of students that can be accommodated every year in our Department is physically limited by the room available in labs, the amount of equipment, and the number of professors. Applications consistently outnumber the Department’s capacity. For this reason, the Department of Communication Studies has a distinct admission procedure, in addition to the normal admission process of Concordia University.
STAGE 1
BA Communication Studies (Major and Specialization) and
BA Communication & Cultural Studies (Major)
Do one of the following:
1.     If you are a new student applying to Concordia University: you must create an application using MyConcordia:  You will also need to submit supporting documents required by the Department of Communication Studies. Applicants must prepare all supporting documents for uploading as one PDF file (‘dossier’). Please see further instructions, below.
2.     If you are already a student in a BA program at Concordia University: you will need to submit supporting documents to the Department of Communication Studies. Applicants must prepare all supporting documents for uploading as one PDF file (‘dossier’). Please fill out the  and see further instructions, below.
3.      If you are already a student at Concordia University but you are not already in a BA program: You will need to apply for a Degree Transfer on .
Applicants must prepare all supporting documents for uploading as one PDF file (‘dossier’). Please see further instructions, below.
Instructions
For Fall 2018 admissions to both BA programs in the Department of Communication Studies, all the supporting documents for your applications must be submitted online. This must be done by uploading one PDF file using the Upload Document feature within your application or in the Student Centre in the MyConcordia portal.
Please upload your documents using the appropriate BA program name in the drop-down menu: Communication Studies Dossier or Communication and Cultural Studies Dossier.
About PDFs: ‘PDF’ stands for Portable Document Format. These kinds of files are very widely used across all sectors of education, business and the arts, including at Concordia. Adobe developed this file format to be used with their Acrobat software, but there are lots of free PDF editors for both Mac and PC. See for example:
A recommended workflow is to create one PDF for each section of your application, using the PDF option in your printer dialog box or directly from your document scanner. Then use a PDF editor to combine all the individual PDFs into one file, organize the pages into the required sequence, ensure everything is included, and reduce the overall file size (under 20MB) ready for uploading.
Communication Studies and Communication & Cultural Studies dossiers should include the following supporting documents:
Letter of Intent: A letter, approximately 2 pages in length, typed, double-spaced, in which the applicant writes about the following:
Their knowledge and experience that would be pertinent to the study of communication, media, and culture;
Their interests in the field of communication and the reasons for applying to our program in particular.
Essay: An original essay, approximately 2 pages in length, typed, double-spaced, in which the applicant writes about their position on some significant issue connected to communication, media, culture or society. Applicants are encouraged to draw on and cite appropriate, authoritative sources using footnotes and a references section. Significant issues include, but are not limited to:
Significant topics in media, culture, and communication;
Documenting war/violence or communicating peace;
The role of alternative media;
The role of political debate;
Media and identity;
Representations of race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality;
Popular media (film, radio, television, web, performance, music, social media).
Student copy of your last school record.
NOTES
Applicants who intend to apply for both Communication Studies (Major or Specialization) and Communication and Cultural Studies (Major) must upload two separate dossiers. Each letter of intent and essay should focus on objectives and interests with regard to each program.
The difference between the specialization and major in Communication Studies is primarily the number of credits completed in the concentration. The major and specialization in Communication Studies are considered as one program, and only require one letter of intent.
Academic Assessment Forms (reference forms)
Two completed Academic Assessment Forms are required. Referees (e.g. teachers or employers if academic assessments are not possible) should complete this form and email it as an attachment from their work email account directly to (email will be announced on December 1st, 2017). The subject line must be just the last name and first name of the applicant. These forms will be available from December 1, 2017 to March 1, 2018.
Complete applications must be received by March 1 at 11:59 p.m. including receipt of all supporting documents (dossier, 2 Academic Assessment Forms, etc.).
NOTES
Applicants who intend to apply for both BA Communication Studies (Major or Specialization) and BA Communication and Cultural Studies (Major) must upload two separate dossiers. Each letter of intent and essay should focus on objectives and interests with regard to each program.
The difference between the specialization and major in Communication Studies is primarily the number of credits completed in the concentration. The major and specialization in Communication Studies are considered as one program, and only require one letter of intent.
After the March 1 deadline, the Department will examine only completed dossiers. Selected applicants will be contacted by phone by the department to arrange interview appointments. Applicants who have not been selected for an interview will NOT be contacted by the Department and will be considered for their alternate choice of programs for possible admission to the University.
STAGE 2
BA Communication Studies
Interview: Interviews with selected candidates for the BA Communication Studies program will take place in April 2018. These will be conducted in English to establish that candidates are prepared for university level lectures, class participation, seminars and readings in English. Interviews are conducted by one faculty member and one student and will last approximately 20 minutes. Approximately half of the interview time will be spent in general conversation with the candidate.
Portfolio: Candidates for the BA Communication Studies program will be expected to bring a portfolio to their interview. A portfolio consists of a sample or samples of creative work that the candidate has prepared (e.g. video, audio, animation, a series of 5-10 photographs, artwork, creative writing). We do not expect professional-level creative work; instead, we’re generally looking for evidence of creative potential.
Approximately 5 minutes of the interview time will be devoted to the portfolio. If candidates would like to show digital work, they are encouraged to bring their own laptop or mobile device, with media cued up and ready to be played/shown. A Mac computer with internet access will also be available.
Commentary: Candidates will be asked at the interview to read a brief scholarly quotation and share their thoughts about it. This will take approximately 5 minutes of the interview time.
Out-of-town candidates: Those who are unable to attend an interview due to distance from Montreal will be notified to send, by a specific date, a creative portfolio and a written explanation of an assigned scholarly quotation. The Department does not guarantee the return of a portfolio if it is submitted by mail.
The Department will recommend successful applicants for admission and the admissions team will provide official notification to applicants.
BA Communication and Cultural Studies
There are no portfolios or interviews for applications to the BA Communication & Cultural Studies program. After review of the dossiers the Department will recommend successful applicants for admission and the admissions team will provide official notification to applicants.

You should include a few of your strongest works that you feel you can talk about and explain succinctly in an interview.
Is there a minor in Communication Studies?No, there is no minor in the Communication Studies program. It is possible that if you are taking the Major in Communication Studies that you could take a minor in another program, such as Fine Arts, Languages, etc., while pursuing your BA in our department.
The faculty in the Department of Communication Studies have developed a basic set of guidelines for Attendance, Participation, and Grading for all our courses. These are intended to enhance everyone’s learning experiences and to ensure consistency throughout our curriculum. For further information, please refer to the currently available syllabus for each specific course.
Attendance: Regular attendance is a requirement. Students are expected to actively participate in all classes, workshops, critiques, discussions and labs associated with courses, and to complete all required course work according to deadlines and guidelines as assigned. Failure to comply can result in loss of marks.
Participation: This grade is based on overall punctuality and attendance in the classes, labs and workshops. Student preparedness, initiative and level of class engagement is evaluated (this means participating in discussions and demonstration of familiarity with required readings). Participation also includes completing all required readings and all assignments on time. Students are expected to be collegial, respectful and tolerant of peers, teaching assistants, technical instructors and professors. The best classroom experience will occur with courteous and engaged participation and interaction with each other, the work, the discussions and debates.
Electronic Devices: No electronic devices may be used once the class starts. All mobile phones, iPods, PDAs, cell phones, laptops etc. must be turned off and put away. The only exceptions are if the Office of Disabilities has authorized such use or the instructor specifically grants permission for use.

Grade Definitions
A Superior work in both content and presentation. This is a student who appears, even at an early stage, to be a potential honours student. The work answers all components of a question. It demonstrates clear and persuasive argument, a well-structured text that features solid introductory and concluding arguments, and examples to illustrate the argument. Few, if any presentation errors appear.
B Better than average in both content and presentation. This student has the potential for honours, though it is less evident than for the A student. Student’s work is clear and well structured. Minor components of an answer might be missing, and there may be fewer illustrations for the argument. Some minor but noticeable errors in presentation may have interfered with the general quality of the work.
C Student demonstrates a satisfactory understanding of the material. Ideas are presented in a style that is at least somewhat coherent and orderly. Occasional examples are provided to support arguments. Presentation errors that affect the quality of the work are more apparent than in B work. Some components of a question may have been omitted in the response.
D Student has only a basic grasp of the material. Sense of organization and development is often not demonstrated in the response. Few, if any, examples are provided to illustrate argument. Major components of a question might have been neglected; and major presentation errors hamper the work.
F Shows an inadequate grasp of the material. Work has major errors of style; and provides no supporting illustration for argument. Ideas are not clear to the reader. Work lacks a sense of structure.
Practicum courses
Practicum courses in the Department focus on the development of creative media practices within the context of Communication Studies research based in the humanities and social sciences. These courses include weekly lectures, readings, critical analysis, workshops, seminars, screenings and presentations. First-year courses include an average of three hours of creative laboratories per week. Second- and third-year courses include an average of eight hours of creative labs and/or field work per week.
