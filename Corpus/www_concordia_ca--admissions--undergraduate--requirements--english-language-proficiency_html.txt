Students completing language tests other than TOEFL or IELTS will be considered for conditional admission on a case-by-case basis.

With a conditional offer, you will start in the Intensive English Language Program (IELP), where you will develop the English skills necessary to enter university studies. You must attain a final grade of 70% or higher at the Advanced 2 Level to meet Concordia language proficiency requirements. All students who have obtained a final grade of 70% or higher at the Advanced Level will take a placement test to determine if additional academic English classes are necessary. If required, the additional courses will be taken concurrently with your chosen academic program. English credit courses may count toward degree programs, with the exception of ENCS programs. Visit .
You may also choose to retake your language test before beginning the IELP. If your new results meet Concordia’s proficiency requirements, you may begin your academic program directly.
