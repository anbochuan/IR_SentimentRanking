My work focuses on the relationship between avant-garde
art and writing on one hand and communication studies and media history on the
other. Inside the academy, I've been a professor in both English and
Communication Studies departments. I've also worked professionally as a writer,
editor, designer and publisher of print and new media. As a result, I take an
interdisciplinary approach to research and teaching, and am committed to the
notion that universities need to search continually for ways to build connections
to people, organizations and things outside of themselves.
My most recent book, Guy Maddin's My Winnipeg (fall
2010), concerns a major work by Canada's
most iconoclastic filmmaker. Through his reinvention of half-forgotten film
genres, his remobilization of abandoned techniques from the early history of
cinema, and his unique editing style, Maddin has created a critically
successful oeuvre that looks like nothing else in Canadian film. My Winnipeg (2008), which
Roger Ebert called one of the ten best films of the first decade of the
twenty-first century, has consolidated Maddin's international reputation. I
argue that Maddin's use of techniques and media falls outside of the normal
repertoire of contemporary cinema, which requires us to re-examine what we
think we know about the documentary genre and even 'film' itself. Through an
exploration of the film's major thematic concerns - memory, the cultural
archive, and how people and objects circulate through the space of the city - I
contend that My Winnipeg is intriguing because it is psychologically and
affectively true without being historically accurate.
My collaborative work over the last six years will
culminate in another volume, titled Dynamic Fair Dealing, co-edited with
Rosemary Coombe and Martin Zeilinger. In this volume, a group of scholars,
activists, and artists from a variety of disciplines and genres will explore
the relations between intellectual property laws, technology and code,
institutional practices and other obstacles to mobility that mediate the
cultural worlds Canadians can imagine and explore as educators, researchers and
creators. The essays will place particular emphasis on practices of dynamic
fair dealing - emergent approaches to the creation, circulation and management
of digital cultural objects that challenge and/or present alternatives to
traditional paradigms of intellectual property.
Work in the planning stages includes a monograph on
conceptual writer and artist Kenneth Goldsmith, which will approach his work
from the perspective of media poetics; and an anthology of essays on conceptual
poetics, co-edited with Vanessa
Place.
