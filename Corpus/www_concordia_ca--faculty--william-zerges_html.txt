Research interests
We are investigating cell biological processes in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii. This unicellular green alga is a popular model organism for research of chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthesis. We have identified two novel chloroplast compartments with intriguingly similarities to the endoplasmic reticulum and stress granules.
Another project is studying translational control in the chloroplast.
