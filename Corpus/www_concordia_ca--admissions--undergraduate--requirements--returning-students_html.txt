Returning as an undergraduate after an absence
If you are a former student who wishes to return to Concordia, but you have been absent for a significant period of time, we may require you to submit a new admissions application.
Regardless of your situation, we advise you to  for information on the correct procedure for a returning student.
Considerations related to returning as a student to Concordia
If you were a Concordia student who wishes to return to study after:
An absence of more than 12 months, you may also have to resubmit proof of legal status in Canada and Quebec Resident status
Attending another institution and attempting at least 12 credits during your absence from Concordia, then you must submit a new application and make arrangements to have an official transcript sent to the Admissions Application Centre. We assess advanced standing as part of the admissions process. If you attempted fewer than 12 credits or if your attendance at another institution was based exclusively on a letter of prior approval from the Faculty Student Request Committee, a new application is normally not be required. You may, however, be eligible for transfer credits for the work you completed during your absence.
You officially withdrew from Concordia University then you must submit a new application. If you attended another institution during your absence, you must also make arrangements to have an official transcript sent to the Office of the Registrar. Advanced standing will be assessed as part of the admissions process.
Returning will also depend on the Faculty you studied in as a Concordia student.
Faculty of Arts and Science: If you have been absent from a program for nine consecutive terms or more, then you will be withdrawn from the program and must meet with an academic advisor before reinstatement into the program.
John Molson School of Business: If you have been absent from a program for six consecutive terms or more, then you will be withdrawn from the program and must meet with an academic advisor before reinstatement into the program.
Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science: If you have been absent from a program for six consecutive terms or more, then you will be withdrawn from the program and must submit a new application for admission through the Admissions Application Centre.
Faculty of Fine Arts: If you have lapsed in a program of study for nine consecutive terms or more, then you will be withdrawn from the program and must meet with an academic advisor before reinstatement into the program.
School of Extended Learning: If you have been absent from their program for nine consecutive terms or more, then you will be withdrawn from the program and must meet with an advisor in the Student Transition Centre before reinstatement into the program.
