Tenure-track position in Applied Linguistics
Tenure-track position in Applied Linguistics
Concordia University’s  Department of Education invites applications for a tenure-track position in Applied Linguistics, with a specialization in second language (L2) pedagogy. The candidate should have a strong research profile and relevant experience in two or more of the following areas:
(a)    the teaching and learning of L2 vocabulary and grammar
(b)    L2 pedagogy for primary and secondary school learners
(c)    supervision of L2 teachers in training.
The Department is seeking a colleague who can teach successfully in both undergraduate and graduate programs, with particular expertise in L2 pedagogy, and who can contribute to curricular innovation. Applicants must have completed their Ph.D. by August 1, 2018, and must demonstrate an excellent command of English and a record of publications and conference presentations. Other assets include a functional command of French and knowledge of the Quebec Ministry of Education’s (MEES) curricula for L2 programs in primary and secondary schools, as required of any candidate interested in supervising student teachers and conducting research in the French language school boards. The candidate should have experience teaching in at least two of the three areas of expertise (teaching and learning of L2 vocabulary and grammar;  L2 pedagogy for primary and secondary school learners; and supervision of L2 teachers in training).
The ideal candidate for this position will have expertise in the teaching of additional languages, applicable not only to English but to L2 learning in general. In addition, research experience or professional experience related to indigenous language revitalization in school-based programs would be an asset, given the Education Department’s initiatives to give greater attention to indigenous education (in collaboration with Concordia’s Indigenous Directions Leadership Group).
The successful candidate will join a dynamic team of researchers with well-established connections with the local second language teaching community and have the opportunity to work with an active and linguistically diverse student population at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. An added attraction is the enormous research potential offered by the multilingual nature of the city of Montreal.
Subject to budgetary approval, we anticipate filling this position, normally at the rank of Assistant Professor, for August 1, 2018. Applications should consist of a letter of intent, a curriculum vitae, a list of publications and conference presentations,  statements of teaching philosophy and research interests, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and three letters of reference. Review of applications will begin on October 20, 2017, and continue until the position is filled.
Applications should be sent to:
Department of Education
1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W., Room FG-5.150
Montreal, Quebec
H3G 1M8
Employment equity
All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply for this position; however, Canadians and Permanent Residents will be given priority. Concordia University is strongly committed to employment equity within its community, and to recruiting a diverse faculty and staff. The University encourages applications from all qualified candidates, including women, members of visible minorities, Indigenous persons, members of sexual minorities, persons with disabilities, and others who may contribute to diversification.
