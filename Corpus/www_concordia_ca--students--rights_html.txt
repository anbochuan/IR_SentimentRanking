The Code of Rights and Responsibilities

When to consult the Office
If you have a problem related to someone’s behaviour on campus and you are not sure how to deal with it, the Office can help you evaluate your options and make an informed choice of what steps to take.
Any University member may consult the Office
Consultations are confidential
The Advisor is impartial
The Office is independent in carrying out its duties
You do not have to file a complaint in order to get information or advice. In most cases informal resolution is both possible and desirable. If the situation warrants, the Advisor can guide you on how to proceed with a formal complaint. If it is necessary to file a formal complaint, the Code places great emphasis on fairness and natural justice.
You may also get advice for situations that may be happening off campus. Although the University cannot intervene in these situations, the Advisor will try to give you information, advice and support.
The full text of the Code can be found in the University calendars and online in
