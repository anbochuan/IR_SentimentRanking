QUEBEC PERFORMING ARTS ON THE WORLD STAGEWhat are the necessary conditions to create a thriving artistic scene?
July 7–17, 2017
Bringing together artists, intellectuals, critics, and scholars, this field school examines the socio-economic context that allows the arts to thrive in Québec.
Participants employ analytical tools to understand and draw meaning from non-verbal theatrical and circus productions with a particular focus on Montréal's unique cultural scene.
Beyond critical and theoretical discussion, students analyze performing arts productions as part of the  festival.
This is a creative opportunity to understand how artistic movements emerge.
While the course is now over, you can still learn about the participants, read the course syllabus and the coverage on Storify, and check out the photo gallery below.
The course was given by Prof. Louis Patrick Leroux, who wasrecently inducted into the Royal Society of Canada.
We wish to thank the curators of the SpiderWebShow.ca blog for allowing us to share the content which was created for their site by the students in this course.
