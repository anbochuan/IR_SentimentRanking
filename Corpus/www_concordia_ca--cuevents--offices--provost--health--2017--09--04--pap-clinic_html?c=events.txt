Weekly Monday Pap clinic at Health Services
A Pap test can help prevent cervical cancer
September 4, 2017 – December 4, 2017, 9 a.m. – 12:20 p.m.
During this Pap clinic (you can't get a full check-up), the doctor can also offer you sexually transmitted infections testing, and advise you on or renew your contraception prescription (birth control) if needed, at the same time.
Health Services is offering these appointments to make it easier for Concordians to get this very important test.
Call 514-848-2424 ext. 3565 to book your appointment. Spots are limited! .
