PhD INEXPERIMENTAL PHYSICSElectro-optics and photocurrents in graphene heterostructures
About the research
and
are offering an extensive funding package for a co-supervised Physics PhD student position at Concordia University in the field of Electro-optics and photocurrents in graphene heterostructures.
The research project will be supported by the expertise in place in the research groups of Dr. Champagne (mesoscopic electron transport) and Zazubovits (optical spectroscopy), and on-site the state-of-the-art low-temperature optical spectroscopy and electron transport experimental facilities.
The primary objectives of the research project is to explore and understand how energy is exchanged between photons, phonons, and electrons in monolayer and bilayer graphene, as well as in graphene heterostructures including other 2-dimensional materials. The student will become familiar with advanced nanofabrication methods, low-temperature instrumentation, optical spectroscopy, and both DC and RF low-noise electronics.
The total financial package (excluding the tuition remission) will be at least $22,000 per year for 3 years. The financial support can be extended by up to two additional years beyond the regular three period if necessary.
The successful candidate will be integrated into the team of researchers and students and will have various opportunities to present at conferences, write articles and join a thriving .
