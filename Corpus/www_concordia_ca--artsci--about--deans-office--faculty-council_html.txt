Faculty Council
Faculty Council
Mandate of the Arts and Science Faculty Council
The purview of Faculty Council differs from, but is complementary to, the administrative and governance functions of the Office of the Dean, which is responsible for setting academic priorities within the Faculty of Arts and Science and managing the Faculty in accordance with Collective Agreements and other University policies. Faculty Council is also the body within the Faculty of Arts and Science that is responsible for making recommendations on academic matters to Senate.
In setting academic policies for the Faculty of Arts and Science, Faculty Council is obliged to conform to criteria and guidelines established by Senate. This does not preclude Council from seeking the authorization of Senate to implement more stringent policies or requirements within the Faculty.
