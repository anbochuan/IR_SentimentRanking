Steps to respond to a landlord who has required illegal and unnecessary personal information
If a landlord has required illegal or unnecessary personal information on a lease or lease application form:
Ask for a copy of the application for your records.
Save a copy of all of the information you provided to the landlord in order to prove your payment history (ensure this was sent to the landlord by registered mail).
Consider doing your own credit check for your landlord rather than handing over the private information required if your landlord performs the credit check.
