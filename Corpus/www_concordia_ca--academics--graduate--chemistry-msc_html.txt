Why pursue a Master's in Chemistry?
In today’s complex and ever-changing world, chemical sciences are fundamental in shaping the future, impacting every aspect of society from health, the environment, to how we live. This program prepares you for this influential field of study by providing occasions to work with internationally renowned . Your research and learning objectives will be supported in multiple ways including access to specialized
and state-of-the-art instrumentation.
With research options in chemistry and biochemistry, take advantage of the department’s knowledge in areas of growing significance, including:
materials chemistry, medicinal chemistry, computational and geological chemistry
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, protein structure and function
nanoscience
topics at the interface between chemistry and biochemistry
You can also experience the immediate impact of your research by embarking on a , in which research is conducted for an employer while directing your work towards a thesis project.
Master’s students who wish to continue their academic training may transfer to the PhD program, upon the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 45 credits.
Courses. The following are required:
6 credits from courses listed under Topics, in the general field of the student’s research project;
Another 3 credits from courses listed under Topics, outside the student’s research project, acceptable to the supervisory committee;
CHEM 655: Master’s Research and Thesis (33 credits);
CHEM 666: Seminar (3 credits).
This course provides an opportunity for the student to prepare and present materials concerning their current research problem in an area of chemistry or biochemistry to a critical audience. It is designed to give students practice at communicating and defending their ideas on a research topic in a professional forum, and should successfully inform a broad audience of chemists and biochemists.
With permission from their supervisory committee, students are allowed to take graduate level courses from other departments relevant to their research problems, as partial fulfillment towards their degree requirements.
Thesis. Students will work on a research topic under the direction of a faculty member and present an acceptable thesis at the conclusion. CHEM 655 Master’s Research and Thesis will be examined by the student’s supervisory committee before being accepted by the department. Students may submit a manuscript-based thesis following the guidelines outlined in the section on
in this calendar. In addition, an oral examination will be conducted before a committee of the department to test the student’s ability to defend the thesis.
Seminars. Each student is required to attend and participate in departmental seminars.
Research Areas. Areas for possible research are listed before the Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy section.
Cross-Registration. Students may, with the permission of their supervisory committee, cross-register for courses falling in the Topics categories in other Quebec institutions.
Admission Requirements. The admission requirement is an honours or specialization degree in chemistry or biochemistry or its equivalent. Comparable qualifications in related areas such as biology or physics may also be acceptable. Qualified applicants requiring prerequisite courses may be required to take up to two such courses in addition to their regular graduate program. Applicants with deficiencies in their undergraduate preparation may be required to take a qualifying program. This does not apply to International Students.
Candidates for the master’s degree may register on either a full-time or a part-time basis. It is also possible to carry out MSc studies on a CO-OP basis with the collaboration of an employer. CO-OP MSc graduate studies are arranged as a form of a full-time or part-time program where the student conducts research of interest to the employer, normally in the employer’s laboratory, but directs the project toward a thesis topic acceptable to the department at Concordia and under the guidance of an academic supervisor in the department. The student will spend one term, normally with the support of an employer, gaining experience teaching in undergraduate laboratories and participating actively in the departmental seminars. This program will be available in areas of chemistry and biochemistry where the department has the resources to provide a suitable academic co-supervisor. It is a condition of the program that the employers agree to the publication of thesis results. Prospective applicants should contact the Department for further details.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Applicants must prepare an original statement of purpose that reflects your academic objectives. This brief (maximum one page) statement of purpose should:
explain why you want to study at Concordia
identify areas of research interest or specific research groups with which you want to work.
Please apply . Read the  for application procedures.
Your completed application will include:
Application form and Fee
An up-to-date, complete copy of your Curriculum Vitae (CV)
and .  Note: Academic Reference Letters AND Academic Assessment Forms must be received in sealed envelopes in order for the file to be considered complete. Reference letters must be on school letterhead and bear the original signature. Uploads/faxes/photocopies will not be accepted. All references must be dated within the last year.
An original Statement of purpose written in your own words. It should outline your background, experience, goals, and why you would like to enter the program
for all post-secondary institutions attended
