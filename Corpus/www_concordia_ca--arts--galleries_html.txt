The Leonard and Bina Ellen Art Gallery presents and produces exhibitions, events, activities and publications focused on artmaking today and on its recent history as it interfaces with various curatorial strategies. Its program, in the form of exhibitions or performative events presented between September and April, responds to the communities, issues, tensions, projections, and changes that shape the society we live in. The work of Concordia students in graduate visual arts programs is featured in Ignition every spring. The Gallery also houses a collection of Canadian and Québécois art.
The FOFA Gallery is an exhibition and research space that reflects the creative diversity, activities and interests of the Faculty of Fine Arts.
Located in the heart of Quartier Concordia in downtown Montreal, the gallerypresents exhibitions and art projects that represent the range of art media and artistic concerns explored by Fine Arts faculty, staff, students and alumni.
The Annual Undergraduate Students’ Exhibition and the Graduating Students’ Exhibition (open to Fine Arts graduates at any level in their completing year) are two opportunities for students to show their work at the FOFA Gallery. Students are also welcome to submit group and solo exhibition proposals for the Main Gallery, the Projection Room and the Gallery Vitrines, located in the corridor adjacent to the Gallery.
