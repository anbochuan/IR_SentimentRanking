CUPFA Orientation on Financial Planning for RetirementTuesday, May 7, 2013, 4:45 p.m., Room: H-763
Presented by: June Riley, Treasurer, CUPFA
Jean L. Freed, MBA, Financial Advisor
RSVP deadline April 20th: cupfa [@] concordia.caThis is a reminder for all CUPFA members, whether you have just started teaching at Concordia or have been here for over 20 years. The sooner you plan for your retirement the less intimidating it becomes and the more successful you will be.
On 7 May 2013 at 4:45 p.m. in H-763 we will have an orientation on Financial Planning for Retirement, hosted by your Treasurer, June Riley, and Jean Freed, President of Financial Visions and another one of our members in the JMSB. There will be a presentation focusing on the three pillars of financial planning: Determining how much you will need, understanding how much you can expect from Government/Concordia Pension Plans, and planning how much you need to save. Along the way we will explain how to budget, and we will clarify the main elements of the Government and Concordia Pension Plans. After the presentation there will be questions and answers with Jean Freed to help you navigate this complex subject.Last year’s orientation on the Concordia Pension Plan was a great success and we are looking forward to a similar turnout this time. This is a meeting for all members – not just those about to retire! Space is limited so register early.
