Behavioural Neuroscience (BSc)
Behavioural Neuroscience (BSc)
Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Offered by:
,
Why study Behavioural Neuroscience?
Hormones, steroids and neurotransmitters start pumping through our brains the minute we’re born. Chemicals like adrenalin, cortisol, serotonin and dopamine play key roles in our emotions. When you study behavioural neuroscience, you’ll investigate the links between the chemical changes in the brain, emotions and behaviour.
The Behavioural Neuroscience option is designed for psychology students who want to research the neurobiology of behaviour. As a student, you’ll follow a core psychology curriculum. You’ll also:
Receive fundamental training in statistics and research methods
Study the history of psychology
Take courses in chemistry, biochemistry and biology
After graduation, you’ll have the skill and knowledge to pursue research, medicine or graduate studies in psychology.
