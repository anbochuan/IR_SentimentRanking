Concordia's standard email address format for employees is firstname.lastname@concordia.ca.
The standard format applies to all addresses, unless a request has been made for the address to be customized.
The light version of OWA includes fewer features and a different layout. This should be used if you are on a slow internet connection or using a computer with unusually strict browser security settings. The light version can be selected on the login page.
NOTE: If you are accessing OWA from an internet browser that does not meet the minimum browser requirements, you will be logged into OWA light by default.
The global address list is a directory feature for Microsoft Exchange. All Concordia email addresses will be published in the GAL. The GAL can be seen in the 'contacts'section within OWA and Microsoft Outlook email clients.

Faculty and staff are given a quota of 2GB in the primary mailbox.
If you would like to archive mail on your own to free up space in your primary mailbox, consult the .
Faculty and staff are given a quota of 2GB. If you want to free space in your inbox, here are some suggestions. If you would like more information, explanations, or help managing your email, contact the .
1.    Determine which folders are using the most space.
It is important to know which folders are using up more or less of your quota on the server.  Once you determine this, it will help in choosing the appropriate resolution.  To do so,
1.    Open Microsoft Outlook.
2.    Go to Tools > Mailbox Cleanup > View Mailbox Size.
3.    In this window you can view the total size of your mailbox in KB.  Please note that there are 1024KB in 1MB, so the user in the screenshot has used approximately 38MB of his/her quota.
4.    Below the total size of the mailbox, the individual sizes of the user’s various folders are listed.  In this example, we can tell that the user’s largest, and therefore most problematic, folders are ‘Deleted Items’ and ‘New Employees’.
2.    Locate large mail items
By default, folders are sorted by date, with the newest e-mail at the top.  You can sort any folder by size, name, or even the subject, by clicking on the title for that column.  Choose a folder that is using a large portion of your quota and click on it to view its contents.
1.    Click on the Size column to sort by size (see example below) and scroll to the top to see which e-mail messages are using the most space. Delete or move the largest ones.
3.    Save large attachments elsewhere
For the most part, e-mail with attachments takes up the largest amount of space.  Since there is much more space to store attachments in your ‘My Documents’ folder, consider saving attachments there and then delete the e-mail.  Here’s how:
1.    Click on e-mail with attachment to highlight it.
2.    Click on File > Save Attachment to save the file to the local disk.
3.    Choose a location (i.e., My Documents folder), then click Save.
4.    Delete the e-mail.
Remember that the e-mail will only be removed from your Exchange mailbox once you empty your ‘Deleted Items’ folder.
4.    Move mail from your primary mailbox into the online archive mailbox
1. Select the mail (in bulk or individually) you wish to move from your primary mailbox.
2. Drag the mail into your archive folder. In Outlook, the folder will be named: Archive Mailbox. In OWA, the folder will be named: In-Place Archive.
For more information about the archive mailbox or how to have mail moved automatically, consult the .
5.    Delete emails
a.Deleting e-mail – Your ‘Deleted Items’ Folder
Deleted e-mail messages are moved to the ‘Deleted Items’ folder where they can take up a lot of space.  The most efficient way to clean up the ‘Deleted Items’ folder is to empty it.  This is done by right-clicking on the Deleted Items folder in the mail folder view and choosing Empty “Deleted” Folder.
You can also choose to delete your ‘Deleted Items’ automatically when you exit Outlook.  Here’s how:
1.   In Outlook, click on the Tools menu and select Options.
2.   Click on the Other tab.
3.   Place checkmark beside ‘Empty the Deleted Items folder upon exiting.’
Once you enable this option you will be asked to confirm the delete.
b.Deleting e-mail – Your ‘Sent Items’ Folder
One effective way to clean up your exchange mailbox is to delete unwanted e-mail. Outlook automatically saves a copy of every e-mail message you send in the ‘Sent Items’ folder, which can consequently grow very large.  If you want, you can delete these messages to free up space.
Yes, by default your email address will be published in the University directory. In addition, your email address will be published in the Global Address List found within OWA and the Microsoft Outlook email client.
Microsoft Exchange is a collaborative tool developed by Microsoft. The main features include electronic mail, calendaring, contacts, and tasks. In addition to desktop access, Microsoft Exchange offers support for mobile and web-based access.
Microsoft software is already being used extensively at Concordia as a result of the University establishing a site license agreement for Microsoft products. Microsoft Exchange's collaborative features are beneficial to Concordia faculty and staff.
For security reasons, Concordia discourages the use of non-native mobile mail (Example: Microsoft Outlook for iOS and Android) apps to access the University’s mail service. To configure your device using the native mail applications, consult the
on this page.
This message appears when you have used your Microsoft Exchange email on an ActiveSync mobile device. The feature simply allows the phone to be wiped of all personal information if it is somehow lost or stolen.
Microsoft Exchange can be accessed via the web on any operating system and can be configured on email clients for both Windows and Macintosh operating systems.
To learn more, visit the
page.
1. Log into the Outlook Web App (OWA) using your netname and password.
2. Select the calendar tab on the right-hand side of your screen.
3. Verify that you can see the appropriate calendar, then choose the "Share" option at the top of your screen and select "Share This Calendar" from the drop-down list.
4. An invitation to share your calendar will open, allowing you to choose the recipient, level of information to be shared, and the message that will accompany your invitation.
5. Send the invitation as you would an email. The recipient will be prompted to accept the invitation once it has been sent.
The security of IT systems is a high priority for Concordia's IT department. Spam is a serious security concern as it can be used to deliver Trojan horses, viruses, worms, spyware, and targeted phishing attacks. Filtering systems have been implemented to block spam, and while these filters are highly efficient, you may still receive spam emails.
Important: Always keep your computer up to date with the latest updates and security patches for the operating system, the antivirus software, and any other applications you use. (If your computer is managed by IITS the
are automatically installed).
Outlook has some features to help you control spam and manage your emails:
Block sender
Use this option to block the sender of a particular email you received. This feature is useful when you receive recurrent emails from the same sender. If you block a sender, all future emails from that sender are considered spam.
Select the spam email, under Home tab select Junk and then Block Sender.
Blocked sender list
Use this option to create a list of senders that are automatically blocked by mentioning the senders’ email address or domain name. All emails received from the domains and senders on the list are sent directly to your Junk folder. This feature is useful when you receive spam emails from multiple senders using similar email addresses (like the same domain name) or if the list of spam email senders is relatively small. Use this option with caution as it may cause legitimate emails to be identified as spam. For example, if you block a domain, all the emails coming from addresses using that domain name will be considered spam.
Select Home > Junk > Junk Email Options and click the Blocked Senders tab. Click the Add button and enter an email address or a group domain.
Junk email filter
Use this option to keep junk email messages, also known as spam, from cluttering your Inbox. By default, the Junk Email Filter is turned on, and the protection level is set to Low - the setting designed to catch only the most obvious spam. If you receive lots of junk messages from different senders, you can adjust the sensitivity of the Junk Email Filter to High so Outlook catches most of the spam emails. You should review messages moved to the Junk Email folder periodically, as some legitimate messages might also be moved.
Select Home > Junk > Junk Email Options and click the Options tab. Select High for the level of junk e-mail protection.
Create rules to manage your emails
A rule is an action that Outlook runs automatically on incoming or outgoing messages, based on conditions that you have specified. They help reduce manually filing or deleting when similar messages arrive. Rules are always turned on and run automatically. For example, when a message is received from someone you've specified in a rule, it’s automatically moved to the folder you designated.
Here you can create a rule using the Rules Wizard by mentioning an action and the conditions that trigger that action.
For more information, consult the
Use with caution and check your spam folders often.
All the methods mentioned above are very useful but you must use them with caution. Depending on the senders you block, the rules you set up, or the protection level that you set for the Junk Email Filter, some legitimate email messages might be moved to the Junk E-mail folder. You should review the messages in the Junk E-mail folder periodically so that you aren’t missing any messages that you want to see. Check your spam folders often at every level, especially if you're expecting a communication that never shows up.
If important messages that you believe should be in your Inbox often end up in your Junk folder, then you may want to review the settings and remove some of the blocked senders or lower the level of junk email protection you previously set.
Concordia provides IT training to faculty, staff, and students and training for Outlook is available. For more information, consult
The online archive mailbox is a specialized mailbox that works in conjunction with your primary mailbox, allowing messages to be quickly and easily archived to a location that is accessible from anywhere.
The online archive can help to free up space in your primary mailbox, which will lead to increased Outlook performance and will reduce complications associated with a mailbox approaching quota.
To move mail into the archive mailbox, select the mail (in bulk or individually) from your primary mailbox and drag it into the archive folder. In Outlook, the folder will be named "Archive Mailbox" and in OWA, the folder will be named "In-Place Archive".
Email clients that support the online archive feature include:
Microsoft Outlook 2016, 2013, 2010, and 2007 (with the most recent update applied)
Outlook for Mac 2016 (functionality may be limited)
Exchange OWA (owa.concordia.ca)
If you would like more information on how to move mail to the online archive mailbox automatically, visit the .
By default there will be no archiving or retention (deletion) policy applied to the online archive mailbox, which means mail will not automatically be moved.
There are 2 scenarios in which mail will be moved automatically:
As your primary mailbox approaches quota, you will receive warning messages. If you do not reduce the size of your primary mailbox manually, the
will be applied just before the mailbox reaches quota so as to ensure you do not miss any new incoming mail.  Once the policy has been applied to your account, it cannot be reversed.
You may choose to opt-in and have the
applied to your account by contacting the . Once you have chosen to opt-in, it cannot be reversed.
The default policy that will be applied when you opt-in or your primary mailbox reaches quota is as follows:
All mail 2 years or older will be moved from the primary mailbox to the online archive mailbox.
No mail within the online archive mailbox will be automatically deleted.
All mail within the 'Deleted items' and 'Junk mail' folders will be permenantly deleted after a period of 90 days.
