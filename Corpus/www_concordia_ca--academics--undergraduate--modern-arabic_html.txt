Why study Modern Arabic?
The Minor and the Certificate in Modern Arabic Language and Culture programs aim to provide a level of language competency — speaking, understanding, reading and writing — in Modern Standard Arabic. In addition, through the inclusion of courses in culture, literature and other related topics offered by Classics, Modern Languages and Linguistics and other departments (History, Religion and Political Science), the programs provide a broad overview of Arabic culture and civilization.
