MSc/PhD INCHEMICAL MODELINGSolvation in Chemical Reactions, Water Structure and Aerosols Chemistry
About the research
is offering one scholarship opportunity for a student applying for Concordia University’s Chemistry MSc or PhD program. The student will focus her/his efforts on developing modeling technologies for applications in the life and environmental sciences. More precisely, he/she will develop computer tools based on quantum and classical mechanics, electronic structure theory and molecular dynamics approaches to simulate the structure, formation thermodynamics, (photo)chemistry and spectroscopy of small clusters to large droplets containing ions, salts, organics and biomolecules. The modeling studies will bring insight into various contemporary issues such as water structure and its implications for biology, the fate of ions and pollutants in atmospheric aerosols, and time resolved radiation chemistry of nucleotides and ultimately DNA. State-of-the-art large-scale computer simulations will be enabled by generous resource allocations from .
The successful candidate will enjoy full access to the , its modern facilities and resources, and its multi-disciplinary environment highly conducive of state-of-the-art research and frequent exchanges with peers and faculty members. He/she will be granted ample opportunities to interact with our international collaborators, present at conferences, write articles and disseminate her/his research while receiving first-class training towards a productive career in academia, national labs or the private sector.

Funding Commitment
The selected candidate will receive a generous funding package in excess of $24,000 per year for a minimum of 2 (MSc) or 3 (PhD) years in the program. The package may include a Research Assistantship Bursary, a Teaching Assistantship, Entrance Awards and Tuition Remissions such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship ($32,400), Merit Scholarship ($10,000), Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD - $35,949), and the Out-Of Province Tuition Remission (MSc - $6,000).
