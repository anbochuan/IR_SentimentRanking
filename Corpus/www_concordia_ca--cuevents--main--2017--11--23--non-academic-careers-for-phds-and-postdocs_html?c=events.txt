Non-Academic Careers for PhDs & postdocs
November 23, 2017, 2 p.m. – 4:30 p.m.
Are you considering a career outside of academia? As a STEM PhD or postdoc, finding non-academic career opportunities has always been a challenge. Despite being highly skilled, the path you need to undertake in order to bring your research to market or work in industry is daunting.
On Thursday, November 23, District 3 Innovation Centre will be giving a workshop to help you as a PhD, postdoc or researcher to explore alternative career paths and take advantage of the various entrepreneurial and funding opportunities provided by government and supporting institution. You’ll learn first-hand from fellow scientists and their experience in successfully venturing outside of academia.
We will be joined by our valued partners, the Chief Scientist of Québec, Rémi Quirion, the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Santé (FRQs), MITACS, Aligo and Robic, who will explain the entrepreneurial and financing programs available, and how to partner with industry leaders to commercialize academic research.
