SCIENCE ODYSSEY
May 12, 2017 – May 21, 2017Concordia's Science Odyssey celebrated science in many forms. Throughout Science Odyssey, we hired student reporters to take photos, write blogs, capture video, and even record a podcast! Check out each event to see their work.Many thanks again - see you next year!
Led by Concordia professors in collaboration with international guest lecturers, students and the general public alike had the opportunity to immerse themselves in a challenging and vibrant intellectual environment. This unique opportunity allowed academic fields to converge while looking at science from a varity of angles. Science Odyssey is an initiative of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC). Concordia's lineup of Science Odyssey events ranged from visits to labs, talks and conferences, school field trips, encounters with scientists, artists and engineers, special exhibits, online activities, and much more.
