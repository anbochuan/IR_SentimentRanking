Biography
Dr. Osana, Concordia University Research Chair in Mathematical Cognition and Instruction, is an educational psychologist who investigates children’s thinking in mathematics and the instructional factors that impact their learning. Her recent focus is on how children interpret and use external knowledge representations, such as concrete objects (i.e., “manipulatives”), drawings, and standard written notation. Cognitive underpinnings of the research include the development of children’s symbolization, analogical reasoning, conceptual and procedural knowledge, and relational thinking, all of which inform Dr. Osana’s work on the effects of instructional interventions. Her research is conducted with teachers and children in classroom settings. She brings her research findings to professional development settings to support teachers’ classroom practice in the areas of fractions, place value, number sense, and counting.

Mathematics Teaching and Learning Lab
In the Mathematics Teaching and Learning Lab (MTLL), we conduct research on children’s thinking in mathematics and on ways to support their learning in the classroom.
Our work spans preschool to eighth grade, and many of our projects are conducted in school classrooms. We study ways that children create and interpret mathematical representations, such as drawings, concrete objects (i.e., “manipulatives”), and standard mathematical notation. The cognitive underpinnings of our research include the development of children’s symbolization, analogical reasoning, and the relationship between conceptual and procedural knowledge. Such cognitive frameworks inform the design of teaching strategies that support children’s learning in mathematics.
