Master of Supply Chain Management (MSCM)
Master of Supply Chain Management (MSCM)
Integrated. Inter-disciplinary. Applied.
Supply chain management (SCM) is about bringing an integrated approach to operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology to manage materials, inventory and goods from their points of origin to their points of consumption.
Our program provides students with an inter-disciplinary perspective, exposing them to a number of business and engineering areas, including marketing, industrial engineering, statistics, finance, change and stakeholder management and information systems.
Why MSCM at JMSB?
Our inter-disciplinary approach goes beyond looking at SCM from a strictly logistics-based perspective.
We integrate all the supply chain stakeholders into our investigation of SCM: multi-tier suppliers, focal company, subcontractors, outsourced companies, business partners and customers, including distributors, wholesalers, retailers and ultimate consumers.
An applied focus in SCM teaching and research is maintained throughout the program. A real-life SCM problem in the field will be tackled within the context of an applied research project.
Who is this program for?
Students from a wide range of backgrounds are welcomed to this program: supply chain management majors and minors, all other business and economics majors, as well as all engineering and science disciplines.
Where will this program lead to?
Graduates from our program will be particularly well positioned for careers in consulting, manufacturing, retail, logistics, distribution and software, as companies over the world are increasingly leveraging supply chain expertise to gain competitive advantage. The program will also provide a springboard for those students wishing to pursue a PhD.
