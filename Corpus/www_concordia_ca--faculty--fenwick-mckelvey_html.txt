Research interests
I study algorithmic media – the intensification of software within communication infrastructure – through cases such as advanced Internet traffic management software and political campaign management software. My approach contributes to communication studies by demonstrating the opportunities to integrate software studies into the field while raising questions about the imbrication of software and communication.
Research topics
Internet policy and governance, Network Neutrality, social media policy and politics, platform studies, digital media activism, digital political communication
