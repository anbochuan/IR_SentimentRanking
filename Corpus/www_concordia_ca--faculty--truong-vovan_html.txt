Biography
Truong Vo-Van began in 1976 his career as a faculty member at Université de Moncton, becoming a full professor in 1986. At this institution, he has worked in various positions as a university administrator (Vice-Dean of Science,Vice-Dean of Graduate Studies, Dean of Graduate Studies, Associate Vice-President for Research, Vice-President - Academic and Research). In 2003,Vo-Van was named Vice-Provost, Research/Vice-recteur à la recherche at Concordia University where he also held a professorship in Physics. He subsequently completed two terms as Chair of the department of Physics before returning to teaching and research. He is now Professor Emeritus of Physics at Concordia.
Vo-Van has contributed principally in the study of optical properties of thin films and inhomogeneous media, the design and characterization of advanced materials, the applications of thin films (smart windows, electrochromic devices, optical filters) and the design and prototyping of advanced optical metrology instruments. In 1984, he founded the Thin Film Research Group at Université de Moncton, a group that is well-recognized internationally. About 40 graduate students have completed their studies under Vo-Van's supervision and his research has led to the creation of two spin-off companies. Presently, he is conducting research on nanostructured materials and devices, with an emphasis on sensing and photonics applications.
Nationally, Vo-Van has served as Chair of two Divisions (Division of Optics and Photonics and Division of Industrial and Applied Physics) in the Canadian Association of Physicists. During 10 years, he worked as an expert on specialized Tasks (Glazing, Solar Heating and Cooling) of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Active in promoting transfer of knowledge to society, he has served on several boards of directors of tech-transfer organizations(microelectronics, telecommunications, photonics, wind energy, media arts,analysis of organizations). In the area of collaboration with developing countries, he has had projects in training and research with the Institute of Physics in Ho Chi Minh City, and a number of Vietnamese universities. He has worked during 3 years as the Chair of the CIDA (Canadian International Development Agency) selection committee for the University Partnership in Cooperation and Development Program. Vo-Van also has been Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee of the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission. For 7 years, he worked as president of the Canada-Vietnam Education Network/Réseau d'éducation Canada-Vietnam, a not-for-profit organization aimed at promoting collaboration between Canada and Vietnam in education and research.
