Current Research Interests
My academic training is in English Literature with a strong interdisciplinary focus on postcolonial studies, the environmental humanities, and South Asian literature and culture.  I teach graduate and undergraduate courses in areas such as globalization studies, the environmental humanities, postcolonial and diasporic theory, critical posthumanism, South Asian literature and culture, and literature and media.
My current research includes a SSHRC funded project,
(Insight Grant, $387 500, 2014-2020)
This project brings together my interest in the history of landscape and the environment with scholarly work that explores the productive tension between established reading practices and those associated with contemporary mobile media tied to place. I have created and designed a locative media application, The , an experimental sound walk that curates the relationship between colonial history and botanical gardens. The app was launched in the Montreal Botanical Garden in May 2015. The
is available for free download at the App Store. Read more here: This project will culminate in a book-length manuscript on locative media, colonialism, and environmental story telling. This work is being carried out as part of the activities in connection with the
I am also completing a book manuscript about imperialism, gardening, and the environment in postcolonial literature and travel writing. This project looks at the history of colonial botanical exploration and plant hunting in South and Central Asia, and its relation to literature and travel writing concerned with gardening, the environment, and alpine landscapes. This research also considers how postcolonial writers appropriate the travel writing genre, colonial tropes for representing landscape, and tackle topics implicated in the history of colonialism such as conservationism and gardening culture. Some of this work has appeared in Textual Practice (2013), Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies (2011), Public (2010) and Postcolonial Ecologies: Literature of the Environment (2011).
My speaking engagements in 2016 -17 include: an invited paper on Kipling and hill stations at the "Kipling in India: India in Kipling" international conference at the Indian Institute for Advanced Study, Shimla (April 2016);  a keynote on Arundhait Roy's postcolonial travel writing at the "Zone of Dispersion" graduate student conference in the département de littératures et de langues du monde de l’Université de Montréal (December 2016); an invited talk at CRIHN, l’Université de Montréal, "Beyond Anti-Conquest: Unearthing the Botanical Archive with Locative Media" (April 2017), and a conference paper on my new locative media project, Global Urban Wilds, at the Geomedia conference at Karlstad Sweden (May 2017).
I have also been invited to contribute an essay on "Anglophone South Asian Women's Writing and the Environment" to the MLA Options for Teaching: Teaching Anglophone South Asian Women Writers (Deepika Bhari and Filippo Menozzi eds.).
In 2012-2013 I co-organized two international events in collaboration conceived to stimulate discussion about the relationships between postcolonialism and the environmental humanities: Imperialism Narrative and the Environment (Oct. 2012), Rachel Carson Centre for Environment and Society, Munich, and Global Ecologies: Nature/Narrative/Neoliberalism (March 2013). These events have led to my recently published co-edited volume (Routledge 2015). I also assisted with the organizing of the Leaders in Conservation: Botanic Gardens and Biodiversity in the 21st Century conference (Concordia Oct. 2014) and the "Infrastructure, Environment, and Life in the Anthropocene symposium (Concordia 2015).
My book,
(U of Toronto Press, 2006), examines the relationship between South Asian Partition narratives, gendered nationalism, and historical memory. I continue to work on this topic through my ongoing research and publications on Hindu nationalism and the crisis in secular discourse in contemporary Indian culture. I have been a member of the organizing committee for the South Asian Film Festival of Montreal since 2015.
My collaborative research includes co-editing special issues of Cultural Studies: Revisiting the Subaltern in the New Empire (2003), Cultural Critique: Critical Posthumanism (2003), and several 'author meets critics' forums that have appeared in Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies (2006), Postcolonial Text (2008), and the International Journal of Canadian Studies (2010).  I am a member of the  Techonoculture Art and Games Research Centre, Milieux Institute for Art, Culture and Technology, Figura: Centre de la Texte et Imaginaire, Digital Environmental Humanities Network, the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science, and I am a  Research Fellow at Concordia’s Loyola Sustainability Research Centre.
I have served on the editorial boards of ARIEL: A Review of English Literature (2012 to present), Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies (2000-2016), and the open access journal, Postcolonial Text (OHP)(2004 to present). In 2015 I joined the Management Committee for the online journal
