AARON LAKOFF AND SIMONE LUCAS
We’re creating a podcast series that goes Beyond Disciplines.
How can we tell audio stories that take us on journeys spanning academic disciplines?
The Beyond Disciplines podcast series features some of the Faculty of Arts and Science’s leading experts. We get their take on topics ranging from sensory explorations to the role of community in research.
Now in its second season, the podcast is part of the Beyond Disciplines event series. We continue to embrace our motto: Mix it up, experiment boldly, and go beyond.
I’m Aaron Lakoff, and I’m Simone Lucas. We are MA students in Media Studies with the Department of Communication Studies
