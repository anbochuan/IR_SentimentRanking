I am currently completing a book called "The Novel and the Repertory 1680-1814" that investigates the reciprocal relations between the novel and the stage in 18th- century England. Major authors include Rochester, Richardson, Fielding, Burney, Godwin and Inchbald.
I am also researching and writing about the manifold cultural representations of Richard Nixon since Watergate in a project whose working title is "Crapola!" Cultural representations of Nixon suggest that the fate of the middlebrow is more important than has been assumed by various theories of postmodernism that have posited as one of its hallmarks a disconnect between class and culture. In this project, I explore the correlations between the fate of middlebrow culture and the politics of resentment.
