"That’s so gay!" seems a casual joke for many, but it represents an important mindset for anyone who hears it, believes Concordia professor Gilbert Émond. This is the kind of homophobic expression that creates a permissive mood of harassment and abuse among teenagers in many high schools.
Émond has spent a good deal of his academic career studying homophobia. After he developed a special questionnaire with GRIS-Montreal for high school students, he found last year significant evidence of homophobic abuse in our schools, both physical and spoken. Many students spoke of humiliation and rejection, as well as verbal and physical harassment by their peers just because the victims are, or seem to be, gay or lesbian. Some of these abused teens ultimately moved to other schools or had thoughts of suicide.

Émond is examining this new evidence to understand how what seems like a joke can open doors to physical attacks in schools. Much of this research is done with GRIS-Montreal. GRIS' mission is to find ways to intervene in homophobia and to demystify homosexuality in schools. Last year Émond also published the book L'Homophobie, pas dans ma cour! (Homophobia, not in my school yard!) with Janik Bastien Charlebois.
