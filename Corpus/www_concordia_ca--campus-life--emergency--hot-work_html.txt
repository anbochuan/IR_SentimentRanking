Hot work
Hot work
Hot work describes any process that utilizes an open flame, generates sparks, heat, smoke or dust and can be a source of ignition for nearby flammable materials or that may unnecessarily cause a fire alarm.
This includes welding, soldering, cutting, brazing, grinding and drilling metal, using a torch and sanding in areas that are not pre-disposed for these activities.
The use of candles, smoke machines, plate warmers and cooking in locations without appropriate ventilation are also considered as hot work activities.
To conduct hot work at Concordia you must:
Complete the online fire prevention form.
Submit the form no less than 2 working days prior to the work or activity.
Follow the mandatory hot work safety precautions
Implement any additional precautions or procedures imposed by University fire prevention personnel
Before you start your hot work

Hot work and maintenance will often result in the interruption or by-pass of a fire alarm or sprinkler system.  Even if a fire alarm system is by-passed, it continues to function however the audible alarms are silenced to avoid unnecessarily evacuating a building due to a planned activity.  Fire alarms are always received and investigated even when the alarm is by-passed.

University Fire Prevention Personnel may impose, a fire watch/monitor or other precautions judged to be necessary for the duration of the fire protection systems interruption.
Any cost associated with special requirements, precautions or equipment and/or university charges related to the interruption of fire protection systems are the responsibility of the person responsible for coordinating the work.
The person responsible for the interruption of fire alarm and/or sprinkler systems may be subject to fees/fines of up to $3000.00, due to negligence and/or not adhering to the established conditions and/or precautions established by University Fire Prevention Personnel, resulting in a false alarm / building evacuation and/or the response of  the Montreal Fire Department.
