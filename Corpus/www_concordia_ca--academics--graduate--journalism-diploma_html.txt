Graduate Diploma (GrDip)
Offered by:

Why pursue a Graduate Diploma in Journalism?
Reporters, editors, publishers and owners understand that in order to maintain a reputable voice in today’s changing media landscape, they must remain committed to telling factual narratives that inspire positive social change. Journalists need to honour members of the public by providing them with credible information to better their lives and communities. Now more than ever, we need motivated storytellers interested in the truth to dedicate themselves to the highest standards of this editorial profession.
The Graduate Diploma in Journalism provides an opportunity for you to acquire practical, hands-on experience across multiple platforms, including print, radio, television and online reporting. Offered over an 11-month period that begins in June and finishes the following April, our program is focussed, intense and supplies you with the skills required to practice journalism and cover timely news events as well as current affairs on deadline.
With the support of acclaimed faculty members, recipients of prestigious honours like the Pulitzer Prize and the Radio Television Digital News Association Lifetime Achievement Award, you will be challenged to be a professional journalist on day one and pursue fieldwork as you explore the theoretical and analytical dimensions of journalism. Benefit from Montreal’s strong media environment where you can network with working journalists and report on stories related to politics, culture, science, the arts and much more.
