Employment equity
Employment equity
Concordia's reputation as one of Canada's most dynamic and innovative universities has its roots in over 180 years of pursuing academic excellence and student success.
This tradition of individual empowerment, discovery, and leadership building was developed by the University's founding institutions – Loyola College and Sir George Williams University – and it continues to flourish locally, nationally, and on the global stage.
The vibrancy of the Concordia community reflects its urban and multicultural environment in the very heart of Montreal. This openness to the world and to new ideas inspires the university to develop an international approach to learning, research and social responsibility. Concordia is a diverse community, well equipped to meet the challenges of a globalized world. It has established formal linkages with 70 institutions in 29 countries on five continents, and its student body is one of the most diverse in Canada.
What is employment equity?
The commitment to provide equal opportunities for employment
Ensure that selection, promotion, and professional development opportunities are based on competencies and qualifications
Identify and remove systemic barriers to employment opportunities
Concordia is committed to employment equity and in collaboration with our community, we analyze our workforce and our employment practices and work towards the achievement of a diversified and representative workforce of the designated groups:
Quebec: Women, Aboriginal Peoples, visible minorities, ethnic minorities, and handicapped persons
Federal: Women, Aboriginal Peoples, persons with disabilities, and members of visible minorities
We make recommendations for setting institutional recruitment and selection strategies for staff groups; assist in the development of action plans for the hiring, promotion, and retention of members of the five groups designated by the Federal Contractors Programme (FCP) and the Provincial Employment Equity Act across all staff job categories.
We encourage you to examine the university's
