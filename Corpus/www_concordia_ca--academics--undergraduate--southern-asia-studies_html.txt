Why choose Southern Asia Studies?
Nearly a quarter of the world’s people live in the geographic area known as South Asia, making it one of the most densely-populated places on the planet.  Representing a multiplicity of religions, cultures, ethnicities, and languages, this diverse group’s interaction over thousands of years is a rich, complex story with lessons for today and the future.
By considering South Asia’s experiences of colonialism, post-colonialism, political activism, multiculturalism, and economics, you will enrich your understanding of those dynamics in Canada too. As you examine South Asian influences on the West, including yoga, meditation, and Buddhist concepts, you will challenge your own ideas and discover alternative worldviews.
Explore Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism, and South Asian expressions of Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Sufism as you discover or enhance your knowledge of languages including Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Tibetan, and Sanskrit.  Through Concordia International, go on exchange in a South Asian country. In Montreal, experience South Asian culture, food, temples and mosques, while connecting with members of the South Asian community.

Southern Asia Studies is an interdisciplinary undergraduate program, which provides students with the opportunity to focus their studies on the customs, social organization, ideas, historical experiences and present-day conditions of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and their neighbours. Students with a major or minor in Southern Asia Studies take courses in Religion, History, Political Science and other disciplines - including Film Studies, Economics, Education, Linguistics, English, and Sociology and Anthropology.
The countries of Southern Asia have one-fifth of the world's total population today and possess the heritage of one of the world's oldest civilizations. This region is of immense political importance, and religious significance - made up of communities practicing Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Judaism and Christianity. People who come from this region, or whose great-grandparents did, are an important part of Canada today, and their cultural expressions contribute to the richness of Canadian society.
