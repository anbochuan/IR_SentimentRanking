MA/PhDIndigenous history and borderlands dynamics
About the research
, Associate Professor and Director of First Peoples Studies, is seeking graduate students to work on one of 3 separate but interconnected projects.
1. Garden River First Nations Dramatic History
Since 1901 to the current day members of Garden River First Nation  have staged various plays to non-Native and Native audiences in Canada, the United States, and Europe. Professor Hele is seeking to address the questions surrounding agency, colonialism, (re)appropriations, and understandings through visual imagery and written texts by examining a range of materials associated with the Hiawatha plays (pictures, postcards, play books, films, newspaper reports, musical scores, etc).
2.  Borderlands at the Sault
This project explores nineteenth-century  American-Canadian borderlands that affected the multiplicity of interactions that characterized the Anishinabeg, Métis, and Non-native encounter with each other and the colonial state from 1783 to c.1914 within the Sault Ste. Marie region.
3. Garden River First Nation - A Community History
This project draws on the resources of the first two, while seeking additional sources to compile a community history that examines the resilience and daily lives of people.  Its aim is to create a snapshot of the history of the reserve without focussing solely on claims issues.
Financial commitment
The selected candidates will be considered for funding comprised of Teaching Assistantships, and Entrance Awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship ($32,400), Merit Scholarship ($10,000), Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD - $35,949), and the Out-Of Province Tuition Remission (Masters - $6,000).
Requirements
The successful applicants will possess excellent organization skills, and be able to summarize texts efficiently and effectively. Duties will include reading newspapers, electronic and microform, as well as primary documents (i.e. RG 10: Indian Affairs), and possibly conducting oral interviews. The applicant should also have some prior knowledge of First Nation’s history, law, politics, or literature as well as be familiar with archival research. The ability to read a second language (Ojibwe or French) is an asset but not a requirement.
