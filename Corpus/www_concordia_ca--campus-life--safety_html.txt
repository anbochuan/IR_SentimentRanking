Environmental Health and Safety
Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) supports an environmentally responsible, safe and healthy work, research and study environment at Concordia University.
We accomplish this by proactively identifying risks and emerging issues and by developing and implementing innovative, practical and sustainable processes to manage them, including inspections and training.
Through close collaboration with all members of the Concordia community, we establish and maintain health and safety systems that ensure a high level of safety, while not limiting or impeding academic freedom or freedom of research.
