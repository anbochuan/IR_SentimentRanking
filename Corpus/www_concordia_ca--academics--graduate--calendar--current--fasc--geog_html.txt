ECON 659 Economics for Environmentalists (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
This course considers one of the most serious problems facing our global civilization: the on-going conflict between economic activity and the bio-physical world upon which all human activity ultimately depends. The course explains the basic theoretical framework most economists use to describe economic activities and the relationship between these activities and the natural world. Understanding the logical apparatus of economics theory shows why market forces and environmental integrity are often in conflict and why economic arguments dominate environmental policy debates at both national and international levels.

Note 2: Students registered in programs in Economics, or programs in the John Molson School of Business, may not take this course for credit.
