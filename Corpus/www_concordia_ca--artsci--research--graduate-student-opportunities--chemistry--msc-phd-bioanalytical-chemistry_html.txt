MSc/PhDin Bioanalytical Chemistry Evaluation of new extraction materials for metabolomics and lipidomics
About the research
is offering one scholarship opportunity for a student applying for Concordia University’s MSc or PhD in Chemistry or Biochemistry program. The student’s research will focus on the evaluation of new extraction materials, specifically, ionic liquids for metabolomics and lipidomics applications. The student will join the vibrant Vuckovic group whose research intersects metabolomics, lipidomics, and biomarker validation, with the focus on improving the coverage of low abundance metabolome.  The primary objectives of the research project are to evaluate the performance of different ionic liquids for extraction of polar and non-polar metabolites, and to apply optimized protocols to metabolite profiling of human biological fluids using liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry. The student will gain hands-on expertise in bioanalytical chemistry, chromatography, high-resolution mass spectrometry, metabolomics and lipidomics. The successful candidate will have various opportunities to present at national and international conferences and author manuscript(s) based on their research.  Vuckovic group offers on-site state-of-the-art high resolution mass spectrometry facility and access/affiliation to mass spectrometry and other bioanalytical instrumentation in three leading Concordia research centres: Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry, Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics and PERFORM Centre.
Financial Commitment
The selected candidate will receive a generous funding package consisting of a Research Assistantship Bursary, Teaching Assistantship, as well as the special Evaluation of new extraction materials for metabolomics and lipidomics Fellowship valued at $10,000 in Year I of their program.  The total financial package will exceed $26,000 in Year I and $24,000 in Year II of the program. Applicants will also be considered for additional scholarships, including third and fourth year funding for Doctoral students, and tuition remissions for International and Canadian students.  The financial support can be extended to an additional semester beyond the regular two year duration of the program if necessary.
