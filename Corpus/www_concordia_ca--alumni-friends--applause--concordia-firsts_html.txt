Concordia Firsts
Concordia Firsts
To celebrate Concordia's 40th anniversary, we combed through 40 years of archives, newspaper clippings, news releases and official publications to discover what Concordians did first on campus, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the world.
Should you know of additional Concordia Firsts, .
Concordia Firsts were produced by University Communication Services and Advancement and Alumni Relations in partnership with Records Management and Archives.
