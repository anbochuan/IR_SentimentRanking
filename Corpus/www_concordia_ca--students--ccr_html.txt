Co-curricular Record
Stand out and get recognized! The Co-Curricular Record (CCR) is an official Concordia University document that highlights your involvement in student life at Concordia.
How to use your Co-Curricular Record
There are a multitude of activities and positions that are eligible for recognition on your Co-Curricular Record.
