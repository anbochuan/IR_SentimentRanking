Existing degree programs are a reflection of research interests, of the professors and researchers on staff, and of the needs of the community served by the University. Inquiries concerning these degree programs should therefore be sent to the .
In conjunction with the degree program, the Dean of Graduate Studies is responsible for ensuring the quality of the admission of students to the doctoral, master’s, diploma and certificate programs of the University. Admission is based on an assessment of the student’s qualifications for the proposed program of study and entails specific credit, residence, course, thesis, and examination requirements, which vary from program to program.

The ministère de l’Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport (MELS) requires all registered students to have a “permanent code” (a unique identifying number) which is assigned by MELS.
Applicants who do not provide a valid code with their application must apply for one upon receiving admission to Concordia University. Information on how to apply for a permanent code and a link to the on-line “Permanent Code Data Form” can be found at the
Students who do not submit or apply for a permanent code will be charged a
Academic Success & Integrity Module (ASIM)
To be permitted to register for future courses, all graduate students must complete the Academic Success & Integrity Module prior to or within their first term of admission. Students who fail to submit the ASIM online module will be blocked from registering for the following academic term(s) and from making changes to their current registration until the module is completed.
Prerequisite Courses
Applicants who are deficient in certain courses may be required to take prerequisite courses either as an Independent student or as a student in a Qualifying Program. Refer to
and
Students taking prerequisite courses are charged tuition and other fees on a per credit basis for these courses.
Transfer Credits and Exemptions
Student may be entitled to transfer credit from previous studies to their new program and/or be exempted from certain courses. Refer to
and
for additional information.
Qualifying Program
Depending on the degree program and on the number of courses required, prerequisite courses taken in a Qualifying Program may be taken prior to admission into a graduate program or concurrently with the graduate program.
Qualifying Program (prior to admission to a graduate program): Applicants who have completed an undergraduate program leading to a bachelor’s degree, but whose preparation is inadequate for direct admission to a graduate program, may, upon recommendation by a department, be permitted to register for a Qualifying Program of advanced undergraduate or graduate studies. Students admitted to a Qualifying Program take undergraduate or graduate courses as preparation for application to a graduate program.
The minimum qualifications for entry into the Qualifying Program are as follows: at least 24 course credits in the proposed field of study as determined by the program; at least a B average in these courses (B- for Diploma and Graduate Certificate courses), with no grade lower than C; and at least a C average in their final two undergraduate years.
Qualifying Programs consist normally of four or five senior undergraduate courses. In certain exceptional cases, students may be required to take more than this number, and spend more than one full year as qualifying students.
Qualifying students must have their program of study approved by the relevant Graduate Program Director prior to each registration period.
Satisfactory completion of the courses taken in a Qualifying Program does not guarantee automatic admission to a graduate program. Students must apply, or reapply, for admission to graduate studies during or after the Qualifying Program. Their applications are considered along with all other applications received at that time, and do not take priority over those of other applicants who may be better qualified.
Students taking prerequisite courses are charged tuition and other fees on a per credit basis.
Qualifying Program (concurrent): Students admitted to a graduate program and a concurrent Qualifying Program are required to complete prerequisite courses at the same time as they complete their Graduate Program requirements. The Qualifying Program normally does not exceed 12 credits but may consist of graduate and/or undergraduate courses.
A student who does not successfully complete a concurrent Qualifying Program within the first three terms will be blocked from future registration. Standard ‘May Continue’ or ‘May Not Continue’ Student Requests will apply.
The prerequisite courses are completed in addition to the regular graduate program and form part of the student’s degree requirements for graduation.
The prerequisite course(s) must be completed during the first year of study in the graduate program.
Any grade lower than a B in a course from a Qualifying Program is considered a failure.
Qualifying students must have their program of study approved by the relevant Graduate Program Director prior to each registration period.
Students are charged tuition and other fees for the prerequisite courses in addition to fees charged for the student’s graduate program of study.
A student who does not successfully complete a concurrent Qualifying Program within the first three terms will be automatically placed on academic probation. Standard ‘May Continue’ or ‘May Not Continue’ student requests will apply.
Deferment of Admission
Applicants who have been accepted to a degree program and who wish to postpone the start of their studies may request a deferral of admission. These students should contact their degree program in order to request permission for a change of admission date. In cases where a program approves a deferment of admission, there is a $25 fee. The
can be found in the
section. The completed form along with the deferral fee, should be submitted to the applicant’s degree program.
Accelerated Admission to PhD Programs
Accelerated admission (fast-tracking) describes a process whereby exceptional students are admitted to PhD programs without a master’s/magisteriate degree in the same discipline.
Students who follow this process must show high academic performance or potential, evidenced by an outstanding GPA, appropriate research publications in the field of study, a research topic at the master’s/magisteriate level which is advanced enough for a doctoral thesis proposal, or other similar demonstrations of achievement.
Students who are accepted for accelerated admission and who are currently registered in a master’s/magisteriate degree program, or who would do so directly from a bachelor’s degree, are expected to complete the course component of the thesis option master’s/magisteriate in the same discipline in addition to the standard academic requirements for the doctoral program.
Internal Transfer
Students currently in a degree program may choose to transfer from one program to another (e.g. from a Master of Arts in Judaic Studies to a Master of Arts in Philosophy, or from a Master of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering to a Master of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering).
A request to transfer from one degree program to another is considered to be a new application. Students who wish to transfer degree programs must submit an on-line application, along with the required application fee. Documentation showing professional and educational achievements outside of Concordia must be submitted if they have not already been provided.
Re-Admission of Withdrawn Students
Students who have been withdrawn from a graduate program for academic reasons (e.g. low GPA, C or F grades) may wish to be considered for re-admission into the program. Normally, students must have been withdrawn from the program for a minimum of five terms in order to be reconsidered. A request for re-admission is considered to be a new application. Students who wish to be considered for re-admission must submit an on-line application, along with the required application fee. Documentation (e.g. CV, transcripts) showing professional or educational accomplishments since the student was withdrawn must be submitted along with a recommendation for re-admission by the degree program.
Re-Instatement of Withdrawn Students
Students who withdrew or have been withdrawn from a graduate program for non-academic reasons (e.g. non-continuous registration) may wish to submit a Student Request form requesting re-instatement to the program. Refer to the
for more information.
