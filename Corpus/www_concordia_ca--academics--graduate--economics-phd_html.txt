Take advantage of faculty-led group study meetings that connect researchers and students who are working on similar research topics. The
also runs a seminar series where you can get general advice for conducting research, writing papers and publishing articles, by faculty members who give short talks about their own areas of interest.
Benefit from resources offered by the , a cross-institutional research center that connects experts from Concordia University, McGill University and the Université de Montréal. The CIREQ-Concordia seminar series invites internationally renowned scholars to present their latest research findings, and our students are also encouraged to register for advanced elective courses given at all three universities.
Program details
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate entering the program with a master’s degree is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits.
Courses. All PhD candidates must take ten one-term graduate courses (30 credits) selected from the Departmental offerings, six of which must be ECON 612: Microeconomics I, ECON 613: Microeconomics II, ECON 615: Macroeconomics I, ECON 616: Macroeconomics II, ECON 680: Econometric Theory I and ECON 681: Econometric Theory II, plus four program electives. A recognition of past graduate work as partial fulfillment of the course requirements for the PhD degree is at the discretion, and subject to the approval of, the Graduate Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies. (See the regulation concerning  in this calendar.) Note: If students have taken courses that are required for the PhD program as part of their MA studies, they must substitute them with a maximum of three directed research courses and electives in order to complete the 30 credits required in the PhD program. The directed research courses are chosen in consultation with the thesis supervisor; they are graded pass/fail and are comprised of independent research work carried out under the direction of the thesis supervisor.
Research Seminar. All candidates must take ECON 806: Doctoral Research Seminar (6 credits) requiring the presentation of a paper. This seminar is intended to aid in the development of a doctoral thesis proposal.
Comprehensive Examinations. All candidates must pass three examinations (6 credits) in the areas of: Microeconomic Theory, Macroeconomic Theory and Econometrics. Each of these examinations is set, read and marked by members of the Department. These examinations must be passed before a student enrols in ECON 806.

Students with a high standing in a master’s degree or equivalent in other fields, such as commerce, mathematics or business administration from a recognized university may be admitted, subject to satisfactory completion of qualifying requirements, if necessary. Students with a BA (honours) or equivalent with high standing in economics may apply for admission directly to doctoral studies.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.

The
aims to promote a stimulating academic and social atmosphere by organizing social events, facilitating seminars and other activities. Seminars organized by the EGSA invite faculty members and graduate students to present their research in economics, and offer you the opportunity to learn more about grant applications and scientific event planning. Doctoral students may also present their own research poster at the Economics Spring Poster Day, an annual showcase of graduate student research in the Department.
The CIREQ PhD Students’ Conference is an annual event held in Montreal that invites doctoral students to present their research findings. The student-run conference provides a great opportunity to practice your presentation skills, disseminate your research to a friendly audience of peers, and learn about doctoral research in your field conducted in Montreal and elsewhere in Canada.
Our alumni are well suited for high-level research and management positions in academia, government, and national and international organizations. Many graduates can be found in research and teaching positions at various post-secondary institutions, including Dalhousie University, the University of Alberta and the University of Waterloo. Recent graduates are also working as deputy managing directors, capital planning functional model owners and independent consultants.
