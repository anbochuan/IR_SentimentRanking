Summer accommodation
WELCOME TO THEGREY NUNS RESIDENCEBetter than a hostel, cheaper than a hotelOpen May 2 - August 14, 2017
Review our  at Concordia
Once exams are over and our students leave, Grey Nuns opens its doors to the public for the summer. Stay for as little as 1 night or as long as 3 months and enjoy a unique combination of a beautiful heritage building, downtown location and excellent value for money.
There are a variety of private rooms available from single to quad occupancy with shared and private washrooms.  All of them are clean, simple and secure just steps away from restaurants, shops, attractions and the public transport network.
Although centrally located Grey Nuns has a beautiful garden with shade trees, pond, picnic benches and volleyball terrain, offering a calm oasis for eating, exercise or just hanging out away from the hustle and bustle of town.
