Concordia University receives a $9.3 million investment for social sciences and humanities research
97 faculty members and graduate students awarded new funding

Montreal, November 15, 2017 — The Honourable , Canada’s Minister of Science, visited Concordia University today to shine a spotlight on Canada’s outstanding social sciences and humanities researchers.
While on the downtown Sir George Williams campus, Duncan announced a $265.4 million investment in university research across the country through the  (SSHRC) Partnerships, Insight and Talent programs.
“I want to commend the grant and scholarships recipients whose tireless efforts help us better understand our world and our relationships with each other,” says Duncan. “Our government is proud to support these talented researchers and scholars who are pushing the boundaries of knowledge to the benefit of Canadians and our growing middle class.”
Concordia’s share of the national investment is an impressive $9.3 million.
Thirty-two Concordia faculty-led projects received funding through SSHRC’s Insight and Insight Development grants for a total of $3.5 million, while 65 graduate and postdoctoral students were awarded a total of $3.3 million through the Insight program.

“At Concordia, we believe that investments in the social sciences and humanities lay the groundwork for a healthy and thriving society,” says Alan Shepard, president of Concordia.
“Armed with vital project funding from the SSHRC, our researchers can continue to advance knowledge and build understanding about important social, cultural, economic, technological and environmental issues.”
In his speech at the minister’s event, Christophe Guy, Concordia’s vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies, congratulated all 97 of the newly funded researchers.
“I’d like to acknowledge the hard work and perseverance of Concordia’s researchers from not only the social sciences and humanities but also business and fine arts, at both the faculty and graduate student levels, who all benefit from SSHRC support,” he said.
“Research is a reputational driver for the university, and the knowledge gained by these particular groups contribute directly to our country’s social and economic well-being.”
Twelve of Concordia’s 32 Insight and Insight Development grant recipients were awarded funding well above the national average.
SSHRC’s Insight and Insight Development grant programs for faculty researchers aim to support and foster excellence in social sciences and humanities research, while the Talent program promotes the acquisition of research skills in graduate students.
The Partnership Grants support formal partnerships between academic researchers, businesses and other partners that advance knowledge and understanding on critical issues of significance.
