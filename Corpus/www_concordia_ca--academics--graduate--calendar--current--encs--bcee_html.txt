See the description of the Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy in the general section for the . When PhD program profiles of individual students in Building Engineering extend into related fields such as computer science, economics, mathematics, sociology, etc., the students are required to take appropriate courses outside the Department.
Master’s Programs in Building Engineering
The Department offers two 45-credit programs leading to the MASc or MEng degrees with specialization in one of the following four branches:
Building Science (E21, E22)
Building Environment (E07, E21, E23)
