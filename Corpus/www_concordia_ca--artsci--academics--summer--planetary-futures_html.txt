August 1–13, 2017
In the face of the current ecological crisis, this class asks students to rethink concepts and practices of environment, ecology, difference, and technology.
This ground-breaking school offers a new lens in which to see the future. By combining histories of colonialism, extraction industries, and energy, Planetary Futures examines the latest innovations in contemporary techno-scientific societies.
Participants take part in site visits that explore resource extraction, colonialism in urban policy and planning, and speculative architectural design.
These visits are accompanied by an analysis of science fiction, science technology, speculative design and ethnography, as well as life and earth sciences.
While the course is now over, you can still learn about it:
