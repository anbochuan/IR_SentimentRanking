Centre for Engineering in Society
Centre for Engineering in Society
The Centre for Engineering in Society is the site of complementary engineering education in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. Our goal is to assist students as they develop skills in communication, innovation, critical reasoning and an understanding of the relationship between technology and society on a global scale. .
Teaching
Our courses focus on core skills identified by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board and in the Concordia Strategic Plan, communication, analytical and synthetic thinking, professionalism, and ethical practice. Through these courses, students gain an appreciation of how their skills influence social and technological change. .
Research
Our faculty research takes an interdisciplinary approach to the public, policy, social, and ethical factors that shape our relationship to technology. .
Research opportunities in CES are available to highly motivated and academically sound students. We welcome inquiries from students interested in exploring technology-related questions in global engineering, rhetoric, technical communication, risk, and the social impact of engineering. .
Service
To help the Faculty community stay abreast of the latest best practices in complementary engineering education, we host occasional lectures and GradProSkills offerings. We also support learning in .
We also administer the

“In the end, engineers are only really useful to humanity if they can address concerns regarding risks to human health, community wellbeing, and the integrity of the biosphere. Engineers can make useful contributions here if their approach is one of cooperation and not of absolute control.”
