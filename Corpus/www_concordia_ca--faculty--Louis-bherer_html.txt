Research interests
Bherer's research study the effect of cognitive stimulation and physical activity on cognitive decline associated with aging and chronic disease.
Normal aging is often accompanied by declines in brain function that can harm the quality of life of seniors. However, not all people are affected in the same way and not all brain functions decline at the same speed. Louis Bherer and his team want to improve understanding of why and how intellectual stimulation and physical activity can help seniors maintain better brain functioning. He's also exploring whether these benefits are long lasting and are similar for seniors of all ages, sexes and health conditions.
