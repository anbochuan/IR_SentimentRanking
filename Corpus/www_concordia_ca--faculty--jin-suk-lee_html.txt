Research interests
The long-term goal of our
research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control plant growth and development. We
study plant development in the context of gene regulation, protein-protein
interaction and signal transduction using the model organism Arabidopsis
thaliana. At the moment, our program aims to understand how different peptide
signals are correctly interpreted to control diverse developmental processes
including stomatal patterning in plants. By
developing a deeper understanding of peptide signaling that controls distinct
aspects of developmental processes, we plan to develop new strategies to
increase transpiration efficiency and biomass production of agriculturally
important plants.
