DEADLINE CHANGES – TEACHING APPLICATIONS FOR SUMMER COURSES
Posted on
by
On January 19th, 2017 CUPFA signed a letter of agreement (LOA) concerning the posting of courses for the Summer Term.  A similar LOA was signed in 2012, 2014 and 2015.  This LOA will apply only to the current year.  The minor modifications of this new protocol were agreed to by CUPFA following discussions that would accommodate the Employer, while keeping the dates at the end of the process intact.  The Employer’s position was that the timing of the initiation of the hiring process was difficult to incorporate into their deadlines.  This new process will now give the same amount of time as that allocated for the other hiring processes in the May and October periods.The dates will be modified as follows:Posting deadlines: Changed from February 1st to February 10thApplication deadlines: Changed from February 15th to March 3rdRecommendation deadlines: Changed March 15th ie. March 24thContract printing deadline: Unchanged April 1st Contract signing deadline: Unchanged April 15th Please note  that the final contract signing deadline remains unchanged.Should you have any questions, please contact Patrice Blais, VP Collective Agreement and Grievance at
