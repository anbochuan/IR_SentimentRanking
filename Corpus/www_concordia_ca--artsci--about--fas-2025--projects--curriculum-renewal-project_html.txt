THE CURRICULUM RENEWAL PROJECT
The Curriculum Renewal Project examines the way we design and re-design our curricula so that our students leave university with the skills and competencies they need to succeed in higher education and beyond.
We are seeking innovative ideas that will provide meaningful experiences to our students such as:
embedding ethics, sustainability, Indigenous studies and entrepreneurship across Faculty curricula
creating knowledge integration programs and platforms
integrating experiential learning
exploring different forms of student experience that may be applied to various programs
creating new interdisciplinary programs and complementary streams of research
collaborating with other Faculties to develop academic programs that push boundaries
developing joint programs with select universities around the world
