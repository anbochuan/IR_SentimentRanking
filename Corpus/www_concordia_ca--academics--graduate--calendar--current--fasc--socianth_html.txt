Admission Requirements. The normal requirement for admission to the PhD in Social and Cultural Analysis is a Master of/Magisteriate in Arts in sociology or in anthropology, with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00, from a recognized university. A superior academic record and strong references are both essential. The intended area of research is also a factor as admission is contingent on the availability of an appropriate research supervisor. Applicants who do not have the required background in either one of the disciplines will be required to take courses (undergraduate or graduate) before being admitted into the program. The number of credits required will vary depending on the student’s personal background but will be limited to no more than 24 credits.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.

Comprehensive Examinations (12 credits). All candidates are required to write two 6-credit comprehensive exams (SOAN 850 and 860). The topics for these exams are set at the end of the first year and the exams completed within the second year of the program. Each comprehensive exam is assessed by a committee of three faculty members drawn from the two disciplines, and formed in consultation with the Graduate Program Director.
Thesis Proposal (3 credits). A candidate who has passed the comprehensive examinations must then submit a thesis proposal to the Graduate Program Director and the thesis committee (selected in consultation with the GPD). This proposal will be explained to, and defended before the thesis committee. If accepted, this constitutes the completion of SOAN 870 (3 credits).
Thesis (57 credits). The candidate who has passed the PhD comprehensive examinations and the thesis proposal will proceed to the final requirement. The thesis is expected to make an original contribution to knowledge, to be based on primary sources and to be presented in an acceptable literary form. The thesis will demonstrate knowledge of theories and methods associated with each discipline. The thesis will normally be no more than 400 pages in length in total. Subject to the approval of the GPD and the thesis committee, a component of the thesis can take the form of a film or CD Rom.
Language Requirement. Given that the bulk of the literature in the two disciplines is written in English and French, reading assignments are given in both languages. Students are required to work towards reading proficiency very quickly. Upon completion of their coursework, students are required to demonstrate reading proficiency in both languages before being permitted to begin the thesis portion of their program. The proficiency level is verified through the administration of a translation test at the end of the coursework period.
In addition, students whose research topic requires the knowledge of a third language will be expected to take the necessary courses and demonstrate proficiency in that language before embarking on their research.
Academic Regulations
Academic Standing. Please refer to the  section of the Calendar for a detailed review of the Academic Regulations.
Residence. The minimum period of residence is two calendar years (6 terms) of full-time graduate study beyond the Master’s degree or the equivalent in part-time study.
Time Limit. Please refer to the Academic Regulation page for further details regarding the
requirements.
Graduation Requirement. In order to graduate, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00.
Required Courses
SOAN 800 General Seminar (6 credits)
This course focuses on orientating the common epistemological interests of sociological and anthropological approaches to social and cultural analysis in the four areas of specialization. In order to maximize interdisciplinary coverage, the seminar will be led by two faculty members, one trained in sociology and one in anthropology.
SOAN 820 Professional Development
This course is designed as a seminar in which guest speakers orally present the results of their work and practical information on various professional skills (professionalization). Students are exposed to a variety of research conducted in the two disciplines and acquire communication and teaching skills necessary for working in the real world (defined as both academic and non-academic). Students learn how to present research results to a variety of audiences, how to address issues related to university teaching, and how to deal with ethical issues in the research context. The course is graded as Pass/Fail. It is mandatory for all students in the program. Each week, students must submit a written report on the presentation of the previous week.
SOAN 840 General Seminar
Designed as a preparation to the research involved in the thesis, the second general seminar focuses on the development of writing and research capacities, preparing research proposals, addressing issues in theory and method in relation to various topics, covering literature reviews. One faculty member is responsible for this seminar.
SOAN 850 Comprehensive Exam l (6 credits)
SOAN 860 Comprehensive Exam ll (6 credits)
Towards the end of their 1st year in the program, and in consultation with the Graduate Program Director, PhD students will form an advisory committee of three faculty members, including their thesis supervisor, to assist in the preparation of the comprehensive exams (6 credits each). A core reading list of 50 to 100 titles is suggested as reasonable for each of the exams. The first comprehensive exam is non-related to the thesis topic while the second is broadly connected to it (but not so closely as to be a potential chapter of the thesis). In both cases, the ultimate goal of the exams is to establish a future faculty member’s academic specialization. After completing them, the student should have acquired sufficient background to teach a course and/or conduct advanced research in the area.
The examinations normally take place before the end of the student’s second year in the program. Each exam takes the form of a written essay (20-25 pages) that the student has three weeks to write. The submission of the written examination is followed in the next three weeks by an oral defense before the advisory committee. Students who fail one of these exams are allowed to take it for a second time during the following term. A second failure leads to the students’ withdrawal from the program.
SOAN 870 Thesis Proposal
A candidate who has successfully completed the course requirements and the comprehensive exams must submit a thesis proposal to the Graduate Program Director and the thesis committee. The thesis committee, selected in consultation with the GPD, is composed of three members representing both Sociology and Anthropology. It may be the student’s initial advisory committee. The thesis proposal should describe the topic of the thesis, situate it in the relevant literature, and discuss the intended research methods. The written version of the proposal is approved by the members of the thesis committee and followed by an oral defense before the committee members. Following this, the PhD candidate will be invited to present his thesis proposal in a departmental seminar.
SOAN 890 Thesis (57 credits)
Doctoral candidates submit a thesis based on their research and defend it in an oral examination. The thesis is expected to make an original contribution to knowledge, to be based on primary sources and to be presented in an acceptable form. The thesis should normally be no more than 400 pages in length (or equivalent if a non-literary format is used).
