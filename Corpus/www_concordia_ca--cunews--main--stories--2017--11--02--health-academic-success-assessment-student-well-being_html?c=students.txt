3)    Services and supports for students related to health and well-being
4)    Opportunities for personal growth and development
5)    Physical spaces that promote well-being and accessibility
6)    Connections to campus
The committee will undertake in-depth consultations with subject matter experts, as well as broader conversations with students, faculty and staff through Idea Cafes.
