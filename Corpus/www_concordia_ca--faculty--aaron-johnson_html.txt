Research interests
My research studies visual perception, focusing on how we view images of real world scenes (also termed natural scenes), and the factors that influence eye movements. By using photographs and video of natural scenes, my aim is to isolate what properties of an image do we use to recognize and classify the type of scene we are viewing, and how do changes in these properties alter our perception of the image. This research employed traditional techniques such as psychophysics and eye tracking, as well as new techniques such as computational neuroscience, gaze-contingent stimuli modifications, augmented virtual reality, as well as studying the underlying neural activity using EEG. My research  also focuses on how various visual (e.g., macular degeneration), cognitive  (e.g., stress, dual-tasking), and the loss of other senses (e.g., hearing loss) effect the visual system, and in particular, eye movements.
This research is funded by NSERC, CIHR, SSHRC, FRQSC, FRQNT, FRQS, and the Office of Naval Research.
