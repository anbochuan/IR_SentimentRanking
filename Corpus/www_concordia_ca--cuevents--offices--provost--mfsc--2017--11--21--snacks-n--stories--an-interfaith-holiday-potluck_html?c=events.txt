Snacks n' Stories: An Interfaith Holiday Potluck
November 21, 2017, 5:30 p.m. – 8:30 p.m.
Come unwind before finals with fellow students over some tasty snacks (bonus points if they’re holiday specialties!) and stories. Snacks n’ Stories is a casual evening to celebrate celebrations, get to know each other and an excuse to take a break!
Do you have a favourite holiday memory? Do you have a funny Hanukkah, Diwali or Ramadan tale? No matter the religious holiday, come share your stories!
Bring a vegetarian item* (if you can) or just bring your best stories.
*If it is also Kosher please indicate when you arrive.
