Printing with WebPrint
To print from personal laptops or laptops borrowed from the library, we recommend using WebPrint.
WebPrint allows you to upload a document from wherever you are (even from home) and release the document from any DPrint machine on campus. Just put money your Concordia ID using one of the DPrint loaders* and swipe your Concordia ID card on the DPrint machine to pay for your print job. Here’s the link:
*DPrint loaders: On the downtown campus there are 2 DPrint loaders located at the bottom of the stairs by the entrance to the library. On the Loyola Campus, there is 1 DPrint loader located on the first floor of the Vanier Library next to the women’s washroom.
