Tenure-track position in Feminism and Sexuality Studies
Tenure-track position in Feminism and Sexuality Studies
Concordia University’s Faculty of Arts and Science invites applications for a tenure-track position in Feminism and Sexuality Studies at the Simone de Beauvoir Institute (SdBI). This internationally known institute offers four undergraduate programs in the field of Women’s Studies (Major, Minor, Certificate, and Specialization), has recently added a Minor in Interdisciplinary Studies in Sexuality, and is on track to add a Major in Interdisciplinary Studies in Sexuality starting in the Fall of 2018. The successful applicant will play a central role in coordinating the Institute’s new BA Major in Interdisciplinary Studies in Sexuality.
Applications are encouraged from those whose scholarship critically addresses questions of feminism and sexuality in the context of Canada and/or Québec. We are particularly interested in candidates with an expertise at the juncture of “migration and sexuality studies,” “sexuality and racialization,” and/or “sexuality and disability studies.”
Bilingualism (French/English) is required.  Successful candidates will have a completed PhD, teaching experience in the field, and a record of scholarly publications.
The application should consist of a cover letter, a current curriculum vitae, statements of teaching philosophy and research interests, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and a sample publication. Candidates must also arrange to have three letters of reference sent directly to:

Employment equity
All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply for this position; however, Canadians and Permanent Residents will be given priority. Concordia University is strongly committed to employment equity within its community, and to recruiting a diverse faculty and staff. The University encourages applications from all qualified candidates, including women, members of visible minorities, Indigenous persons, members of sexual minorities, persons with disabilities, and others who may contribute to diversification.
