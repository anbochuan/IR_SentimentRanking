Hillary Kaell completed her doctorate in American Studies at Harvard University, specializing in the history and practice of North American Christianity.
Her recent book, Walking Where Jesus Walked (New York University Press, 2014) is the first comprehensive study of contemporary American Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Hillary was a Research Fellow in residence at Princeton University’s Center for the Study of Religion (2014) and was selected as a Young Scholar in American Religion by the Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture (2013-2015).
Currently, she sits on the executive board of the Society for the Anthropology of Religion.
She has collaborated on a number of public education projects, including as a paid consultant on the PBS television series God in America and as co-host of New Books in Religion, a monthly podcast series featuring interviews with authors. At Concordia she teaches courses related to U.S. Christian history and the anthropology of religion.
