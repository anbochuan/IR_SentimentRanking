Students with children
Trying to study while raising a family? Feeling isolated? Connect with the Concordia University Student Parents Centre (CUSP)! We provide an accessible space to study but also a place to share interests and develop a support network. Drop by the Centre to see how we can help you achieve your academic goals.
Our space
We're a child-friendly space on campus. Come visit! We have a computer lab, a kitchen and a lounge for you to use.
Programs & events
CUSP support student parents many ways: a computer lab and lounge, a school supplies program, winter coat and toy bazaars and more.
Finances & budgeting
Here are a list of provincial and Concordia resources to help support your family while you study.
How to find childcare
While CUSP does not provide childcare, we keep up-to-date information on childcare and contacts for Concordia's two CPE daycares.

Volunteer at CUSP
We are looking for volunteers that love working with children and are interested in helping them with their English, French or Math homework.
Free goods bazaar: drop-off dates
Cleaning out your closets, get rid of slightly used clothing or toys and books for children and adults? We're holding our annual Free Goods Bazaar to help students that are studying while raising a family.
Affordable food
In collaboration with both our Professionals in Student Services Departments and external Professionals, CUSP offers a wide range of workshops tailored to your specific needs as student parents.  The workshops cover topics such as managing your finances, creating and maintaining balance in your life, all to help you succeed in your academic career.
