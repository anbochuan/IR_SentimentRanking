Why study Computer Applications and Mathematics and Statistics?
Crunch numbers to the nth degree — and see what happens. When you study computer science and mathematics, you’ll use algorithms and computational theory to create mathematical models or define formulas that solve mathematical problems. In other words, you'll design new tools that can predict the future.
The Computer Applications option gives students the flexibility to combine a traditional computer science degree with a non-traditional field. Our state-of-the-art labs for high-performance computing, networks and artificial intelligence will give you experience with the tools you’ll use in the field. Through labs, lectures and projects, you’ll also:
Investigate the computational limits of the algorithms and data structures that support complex software systems
Develop new applications and tools in multi-disciplinary areas of science and research
Explore opportunities for advanced computer modeling and simulation
Program details
A Bachelor of Computer Science, a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, .
The core provides a basic and broad study of theory, mathematical basics, programming methodology, computer architecture, data structures, operating systems, and software engineering.
The Mathematics and Statistics option combines a Major in Computer Science with a Major in Mathematics and Statistics. It provides a foundation for integrated studies in computer science and mathematics. The mathematics component of the program includes topics that overlap with computer science, such as modeling, symbolic computation, and combinations, as well as the standard topics of a mathematical curriculum.
We offer an  to computer science students with high academic standing. You may apply to the honours program once you have completed 30 credits.

CEGEP APPLICANTS
Admission is based on applicants’ overall CRC plus preferably a minimum of 24 in mathematics, and completion of the following classes as part of their DEC. Missing courses will be added to the program.
For all BCompSc programs (except the Computer Systems Option):
MATH 103 or 201-NYA and 203 or 201-NYB and 105 or 201-NYC
STUDENTS COMPLETING A THREE-YEAR TECHNICAL DEC
Students completing a three-year technical DEC in a related field may also be eligible for admission without the specified profile provided they achieve a minimum overall CRC indicated below and preferably a minimum of 24 in math and physics course(s) required for their Cegep program. Missing prerequisites will be added to their program. Students may be eligible for exemptions/transfer credits based on course equivalencies.
UNIVERSITY TRANSFER APPLICANTS AND MATURE STUDENT
Applicants who meet the minimum entry requirements are encouraged to apply and may still be considered for admission, provided they have completed the majority of the prerequisite courses. Transfer credits may be considered on a course-by-course basis.
Prerequisites for university transfer applicants
The following courses are required in addition to the program and may be completed at another post-secondary institution prior to admission or at Concordia.
For all BCompSc programs (except the Computer Systems Option):
Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra
MINORS
Engineering students are able to add a minor in another discipline once they have completed at least 21 credits and if they maintain a GPA of 2.70. Refer to the
for details.
Minimum cut-off averages
Applicants who meet the minimum cut-off averages are not guaranteed admission. Grades in Math and Physics (Chemistry, if Physics not offered) should normally meet the minimum cut-offs. IB Math and Physics (HL preferred) should be 5 for all programs, except 6 for Aerospace.
Quebec Cegep (CRC): 27.000
Canadian High Schools: 87%
U.S. High Schools: 3.2 (B+)
University Transfers: 3.2
International Bacc. (IB): 30
Bacc. Français: 14
