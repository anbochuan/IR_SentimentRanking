Requesting Late Completion of course work
The deadlines for completion of course assignments are given to students on the first day of class. The “INC” notation is assigned when an instructor has agreed that a student may complete work after the deadline.
This application is to be completed by the student and brought to the Birks Student Service Centre (SGW-LB185) with payment of $25 of the application fee payable by money order or debit card (Interac).
If the course is still in progress you must ask your instructor to sign the form.
If a final grade has already been assigned for the course it must include an “INC” notation next to the grade. If a final grade has already been assigned to the course and no “INC” notation appears next to the grade then you must have the  instructor sign the form as this will indicate his agreement to grant a late completion.
A student with an “R” grade or “NR” notation in a course may not apply for late completion in that course.

the evaluation of the work was demonstrably unfair.
