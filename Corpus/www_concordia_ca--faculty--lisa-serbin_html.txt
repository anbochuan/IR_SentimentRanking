Research interests
My research program focuses on the inter-generational transfer of psycho-social risk, and on the health and development of children who are at risk for developmental problems and psychopathology. Ongoing studies examine risk and resiliency in the offspring of the original Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project participants: a group of several hundred children and adolescents from inner-city backgrounds who have been followed intensively since early childhood.
Specific projects focus on the effects of poverty and environmental stress on children’s health over time; predictors of successful trajectories in children who are at risk for school failure; and understanding the environmental, neuro-endocrine and parenting factors in the development of internalizing disorders in children. Specific research projects are funded by CIHR, SSHRC, and FQRSC.
