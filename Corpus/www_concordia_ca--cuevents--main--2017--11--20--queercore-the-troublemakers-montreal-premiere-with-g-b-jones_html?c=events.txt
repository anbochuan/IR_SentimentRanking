QUEERCORE + THE TROUBLEMAKERS – Montreal premiere with G.B. Jones
November 20, 2017, 7 p.m. – 9 p.m.
Join Cinema Politica Concordia for the Montreal premiere of Queercore: How To Punk A Revolution - a raucous look at the Queercore movement, which began as a queering of the punk scene and morphed into a rad response to homonormativity and the straight world.
Artist, filmmaker, musician, zine publisher, and matriarch of Queercore GB Jones will be in attendance and her brilliant short film THE TROUBLEMAKERS will launch the evening!
This event is presented in collaboration with Mediaqueer.ca. The event is being co-presented with AlterHéros, The Union for Gender Empowerment, Queer Concordia and RLQ - Réseau des lesbiennes du Québec - Femmes diversité sexuelle LGBT.
Admission is by donation ($5-10 suggested). The venue is wheelchair accessible.
QUEERCORE: HOW TO PUNK A REVOLUTION
Yony Leyser / Germany / 2017 / 83' / English
What happens when the community you need is not the community you have? Tell yourself it exists over and over, make fan zines that fabricate hordes of queer punk revolutionaries, create subversive movies and distribute those movies widely — and slowly, the community you’ve fabricated might become a real and radical heartbeat that spreads internationally. This is the story that Queercore tells, from the start of a pseudo-movement in the mid-1980s, intended to punk the punk scene, to the widespread rise of artists who used radical queer identity to push back equally against gay assimilation and homophobic punk culture.
THE TROUBLEMAKERS
G.B. Jones / Canada / 1990 / 20' / English
The Troublemakers follows the lives of four down-on-their-luck characters. Surrounded by the vestiges of conspicuous consumption, they struggle to survive outside of society, fashioning their own aesthetics of poverty and devising strategies to navigate a surveillance society, evading or performing for cameras everywhere.
The Troublemakers is equally fact and fiction, documentary and performance, home movie and narrative - the line is blurred and distinctions become meaningless. Shot in the condemned home of director G.B. Jones and lead actors Caroline Azar and Bruce LaBruce, the total cost of the film was the price of 7 cartridges, 3 minutes in length, of Super 8 film.
