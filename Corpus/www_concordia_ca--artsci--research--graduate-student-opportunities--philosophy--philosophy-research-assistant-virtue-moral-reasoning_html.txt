RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIPIN PHILOSOPHYWorkshop – Virtue and Moral Reasoning under Oppressive Social Conditions
About the research
Supervisor: Dr. Katharina Nieswandt, Assistant Professor of Philosophy
How should we think about virtue and practical rationality under oppressive conditions? Practical rationality and virtues are often understood in terms of ideals, such as: fully flourishing agents, ideal observers, or reasoners who are not subject to influences of sensibility. It is unclear, however, whether such ideals are helpful for us, non-ideal agents when facing real-life decisions in a non-ideal world.
One well-known problem for virtue theories here is that a less than fully virtuous agent shouldn't always do what a fully virtuous agent would do in her situation. Must we perhaps turn to conceptions such as care, social practices, spheres of virtues, bounded rationality, moral advice or the like to determine the role of virtues and rationality under non-ideal social and political conditions?
This will be the topic of a workshop taking place on February, 10-11, 2018.
