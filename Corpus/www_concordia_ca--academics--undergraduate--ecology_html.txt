Why study Ecology?
Learn about the amazing web of life that we are embedded in. When you study Ecology, your field of view opens to reveal the intricate relationships among all living things. As an ecologist, you will explore the connections among different organisms and their interaction with soil, air, water and radiation from the sun. This program will prepare you to conduct research on ecology and evolution, monitor and manage living resources, engage in sustainable development, be a champion for biodiversity, and protect the planet.
Our Biology Department features a computer lab and teaching labs that will introduce you to the state-of-the-art analysis tools used in ecology research. Small class sizes foster strong student-professor relationships. As an Ecology student, you'll follow the Biology core curriculum and additional courses focused on Ecology. Through labs, lectures and tutorials you'll also:
Study population growth and the dynamics of competition, predation and parasitism
Explore the evolution, biodiversity and ecology of organisms and study their physiology and behaviour
Receive training in field research, molecular ecology and biostatistics
Concordia’s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for a career in the sciences or paves the way for future graduate studies.
