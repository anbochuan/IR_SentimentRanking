Academic visitors
Each year, Concordia welcomes a number of academic visitors from around the world to its campus. "Academic visitor" refers to an individual who is not a registered Concordia student or postdoctoral fellow or who does not hold an academic or research appointment covered by the provisions of a collective agreement. There are generally two types of Academic Visitors at Concordia:
"Visiting Scholars" are faculty members and research fellows at other institutions who are invited to campus by a Concordia faculty member to conduct collaborative research activities.
"Research Interns" are undergraduate or graduate students who are invited to campus by a Concordia faculty member to conduct collaborative research activities.
Activities academic visitors conduct on campus include:
Research in collaboration with Concordia faculty
Short-term teaching, seminars, lectures, or panels
Exhibitions and performances
Evaluators for graduate theses, examinations, performances, exhibitions

First, a Concordia professor must agree to host you on campus for a specific project and set period of time AND be willing to obtain the necessary approval from her or his department in order for you to be issued an official Letter of Invitation to Concordia. Where applicable, she or he must also be willing to pay the required Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) $230 employer compliance fee of $230 using either a Concordia corporate card or their own credit card so that an IRCC Offer of Employment may be issued so you can apply for a work permit.  Concordia University does not cover this fee; the inviting professor is responsible for identifying funding for it and under no circumstances can they ask you to cover or reimburse them for it.
