Communications is the bedrock of 21st century business
Successful corporations need to effectively communicate with their principal stakeholders - employees, clients, suppliers, partners, shareholders and members of the general public - in a transparent and timely fashion. Thanks to the creation of the Luc Beauregard Centre of Excellence in Communications Research at the John Molson School of Business, students and academics will unite to advance knowledge in corporate and marketing communications. The Centre’s ultimate goal is to strengthen exchanges between industry and academia, better understand the role of communications in business and propel excellence in doctoral studies.
