Research interests
My predominant research interest focuses on pediatric cardiovascular behavioral medicine.   I am particularly interested in the progression of cardiovascular disease risk factors along the developmental spectrum and community preventions efforts utilizing public-health perspectives.   As part of my line of research, I am examining the pathogenesis of subclinical disease markers (cardiovascular reactivity, metabolic functioning, cardiac structural changes) across childhood and adolescence as mediated by potential behavioral (diet, exercise, lifestyle factors), environmental (stress exposure, social support, contextual effects), and psychological (coping style, cognitions, mood) mechanisms that influence these markers and possible confer susceptibility to developing cardiovascular disease.
