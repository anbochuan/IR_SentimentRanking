Why study Pure and Applied Mathematics?
Mathematics is a universal language that explains the currents of the ocean, string theory, the spiral of a snail’s shell or the growth of a fern. When you study pure and applied mathematics, you enter a field that has both a rich history and many future career possibilities. As a mathematician, you’ll design and analyze mathematical models and develop systems for testing and evaluation. In essence, you will use mathematics to find creative solutions for systems such as communications, software development, encryption technologies, banking and drug testing.
Through labs and lectures, you will learn to use professional software tools for mathematics and data analysis applications. You’ll also learn to think in the abstract and fine-tune your analytical skills.
After graduation, students have the knowledge and skill to design and analyze mathematical systems in any number of scientific or business fields. This program is designed to prepare students for graduate studies.
Program Details
A Bachelor of Arts or Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, .
Concentrations:
Honours in Pure and Applied Mathematics (66 credits)*
Specialization Pure and Applied Mathematics (60 credits)
*Admission is to the Specialization. Students in the specialization program seeking admission to the honours program may apply to the departmental honours advisor – normally following the completion of 30 credits.
.
