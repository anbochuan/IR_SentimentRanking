This intro will walk you through the basics of using vector graphics. You'll then print your design as a small vinyl decal (cut-out sticker). Bonus: the digital die cutting machine can also draw and cut paper; time allowing we will demonstrate these features. Bring your laptop or sign one out from the Loans & Returns desk.
