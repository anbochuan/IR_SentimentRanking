Research interests
Our lab works toward elucidating the ecological and evolutionary drivers of biological diversity on Earth. We borrow concepts and tools from community
ecology and biogeography to try and gain a mechanistic understanding of the
emergence, distribution and maintenance of diversity. To accomplish this, we
conduct observational and experimental field studies and compile comprehensive
databases on the distributions, ecological characteristics and evolutionary
history of species.
