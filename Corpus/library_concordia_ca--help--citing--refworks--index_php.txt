Important information regarding links beginning with https
On August 23, 2017 our proxy began using a new method to access subscription resources via https to minimize browser certificate warnings such as this:
Currently, to link to documents (like articles) to which Concordia Library subscribes, a "proxy" must be added to the link. A regular link might look like this:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2015.04.008
A "proxied" link will look like this:
http://0-dx.doi.org.mercury.concordia.ca/10.1016/j.paid.2015.04.008
The change that is occurring affects links that begin with https, instead of http. For links
beginning with https, it is recommended that the link be changed to begin with http. If the http
version of the link does not point to the desired resource, it is possible to manually create a link
which will work by replacing the periods, in a portion of the link, to dashes:
Original link: https://0-www.resource.com.mercury.concordia.ca/path
New link: https://0-www-resource-com.mercuryconcordia.ca/path
RefWorks' June 17, 2015 migration to U.S. based server
How did RefWorks change?
Concordia Libraries’ RefWorks service, which is a voluntary service, moved from being hosted on a Canadian server to a U.S. based server.
As a result of the migration your citations, files if any, e-mail address and name are stored on the US server and will be subject to legislation applicable in the US, including the US PATRIOT ACT, which allows US authorities to have access to the personal information that you provide.
When did this happen?
The migration happened on June 17, 2015.
Why did Concordia's RefWorks service move to an American server?
Concordia's RefWorks service moved to an American server because the Canadian service, which has been hosted through a library consortium called Scholars Portal, has been discontinued.
What changed?
In short, there are no major changes to how the service works, and everything essentially functions as it did on the Canadian server. As a result of the migration process, however, Concordia RefWorks users will need to be aware of some technical changes (listed below).
The URL (i.e. web address) of our RefWorks service changed, so you will need to update any bookmarks or links pointing to our RefWorks service. For the new URL, scroll to the top of this page and click "Login to RefWorks".
The URL (i.e. web address) of any shared accounts or shared folders (via RefShare) has also changed. To obtain the new URL for a shared account or for any shared folders, follow these steps:
Log into your RefWorks account.
Click on the "Organize & Share Folders" tab.
For the new URL of your shared account, go to "Share Entire Database", mouse over icon of the folder with a person popping out of it, and click on "Share Link".
For the new URL of any shared folder(s), go to the folder(s), mouse over the icon of the folder with a person popping out of it, and click on "Share Link".
Any RefWorks users who use Write-N-Cite will need to re-install this software plug-in, which will have a new name: ProQuest for Word. Here's how:
First, uninstall Write-n-Cite from your computer using
Then, make sure your computer has the latest versions of the following programs: , , .
Log into your RefWorks account.
Click on "Tools" then "ProQuest for Word" (i.e. formerly Write-n-Cite).
Follow the instructions to download and install the new version of ProQuest for Word (i.e. formerly Write-N-Cite).
Any RefWorks Write-n-Cite users who started using Write-n-Cite on a document before the migration will have to change some settings in MS Word to continue to be able to work on the same document with the new version of Write-n-Cite. Here are the instructions for
and .
Once the migration is complete, some users will receive an email that indicates a new login name (which will be the email address used to create your account).
The U.S. based version of RefWorks integrates any folders or databases shared with you directly into your RefWorks account. Watch this
to learn more.
The U.S. based version of RefWorks will also provide RefWorks account holders with free access to ProQuest's new web-based reference and document management software called Flow, which is in beta mode (i.e. still being developed), and that will eventually replace the current version of RefWorks (i.e. Flow is essentially RefWorks 3.0). More info about Flow can be found .
Any RefWorks users who use the RefGrab-it bookmarklet will need to update it. Here's how:
Delete the current bookmarklet.
Then, login to your account
and then follow .
What are my options if I don't want my account hosted on the U.S. RefWorks server?
If you would not like your account hosted on the U.S. RefWorks server you can export your data and then delete your account.
First you need to export the data from your account. You can then move it to other research management software such as . But please be aware that Zotero's servers are also hosted in the United States. General instructions on how to export your references can be found . Instructions on how to export your references to Zotero can be . RefWorks users should also be aware that your folder structure, attachments, and shared folders will not export and will be lost during this process.
Then, we can delete your RefWorks account. In order to do this, please contact your librarian:
Login to your RefWorks account.
Click on "Help" then "Email Your Librarian".
Please provide your RefWorks username and indicate that you would like to delete your account.
Who should I contact if I need help or if I have questions?
