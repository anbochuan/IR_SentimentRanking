He is a non-resident fellow with the (Genocide) Documentation Center - Cambodia, The Sleuk Rith Institute, specializing in racism and genocides. He has written extensively on democratization, Islamophobia and Rohingya genocide in his native country of Burma, and served as a member of the panel of judges at the Permanent Peoples Tribunal (PPT) on Sri Lanka (2013) & initiated the PPT on Myanmar the same year. He was educated at the University of Mandalay (Burma), the University of California-Davis, the University of Washington and holds a PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
