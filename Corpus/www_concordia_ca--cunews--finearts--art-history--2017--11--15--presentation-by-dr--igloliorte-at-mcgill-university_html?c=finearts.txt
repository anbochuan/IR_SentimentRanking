Faculty member Dr. Heather Igloliorte will be presenting a talk at McGill University titled “Instructors and Innovators: Unconventional Inuit Art in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries.”
In this presentation Dr. Heather Igloliorte (Inuk, Concordia University Research Chair) examines the history of modern and contemporary Inuit art by investigating how artistic innovation and interventions have changed and expanded the field of Inuit art history and practice. Igloliorte examines the role of Qallunaat arts instructors and their Inuit collaborators in the past and present, and explores how artists have broken from conventions and expectations in Inuit art through a variety of styles and media.
The event is taking place at McGill university (845 Sherbrooke O) at the Arts W-215 at 4:00pm on November 16, 2017. It is free and open to the public. A reception will follow.
