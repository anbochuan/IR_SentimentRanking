Concordia Multi-faith Day of Action
November 28, 2017, 10:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m.
Join us for our monthly Day of Action at the MFSC. We’ll be making cookies again (they were too much of a hit not to!) along with sandwiches, then heading out to feed the needy.
This time we’ll also be thinking about food and spirituality. What do the different spiritual traditions have to say about feeding others and the needy? How do they express it? Come learn, get inspired and share your own wisdom and thoughts!
