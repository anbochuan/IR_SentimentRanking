Teaching activities
Teaching
My primary teaching interest is in biochemistry. I regularly teach Biochemistry I (CHEM271) and Biochemistry II (CHEM375). Biochemistry I is an introductory course and covers the basics of biochemistry including enzymology, protein structure and metabolism. Biochemistry II covers more of the specific biochemical reactions involved in metabolic pathways. I also teach Discovering Biotechnology (CHEM209) which is an introduction to the world of biotechnology for non-scientists. This course covers topics such as cloning and genetic engineering and includes discussions of the societal and ethical issues that are involved. In the past few years I have also taught graduate courses in Protein Targeting and Membrane Biochemistry.
