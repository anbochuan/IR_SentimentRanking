MSc/PhD IN INORGANIC MATERIALS CHEMISTRYDesign and Synthesis of Metal–Organic Frameworks for Environmental Applications
About the research
Dr. Ashlee Howarth is offering an opportunity for one MSc or PhD student interested in applying to the . The student will learn about the synthesis, characterization, and activation of porous materials and how to design and develop this class of materials for applications in wastewater remediation.
Research in the Howarth group combines inorganic and materials chemistry to design and synthesize new metal–organic frameworks tailored towards applications in the removal, degradation, and sensing of chemical contaminants in water. The selected MSc/PhD student will develop basic skills in organic synthesis and advanced skills in: i) inorganic synthesis, ii) porous materials characterization, and iii) analytical techniques for applications testing. The selected candidate will have access to state-of-art research facilities at Concordia University including research centres such as the Integrated Platform for Biomolecular Function, Interactions and Structure (BIOFINS), the Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry, and the Centre for NanoScience Research. The multidisciplinary skills attained will prepare the selected candidate for a career in academia or industry.
Financial commitment
The selected candidates will receive a funding package comprised of Research Assistantship Bursaries, Teaching Assistantships, and entrance awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship ($32,400), Merit Scholarship ($10,000), Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD - $35,949), and the Out-Of Province Tuition Remission (Masters - $6,000).
Requirements
Applicants should be highly motivated with an interest in conducting research and specifically in the areas of inorganic materials chemistry and porous materials while targeting environmental applications. The admission requirement is an honours or specialization degree in chemistry or biochemistry or its equivalent.
