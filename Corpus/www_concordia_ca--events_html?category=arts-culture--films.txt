Governor General Award-Winning Author Peter Behrens, will hold a Master Class in
screenwriting for film and theatre students at Concordia University. Students will learn his
thoughts on storytelling, adaptation, dialogue, character development, and what makes a
compelling story for the screen. The class will feature a Q&A period with Mr. Behrens.
Peter Behrens is an active member of the Writers Guild of America (West) and has worked in Los Angeles and New York writing & rewriting feature screenplays & teleplays. He has lectured at UCLA's School of Theater Film & Television and Sarah Lawrence College and for many
years taught "The Art of the Rewrite" at Simon Fraser University's Praxis Screenwriters Workshop. His first novel The Law of Dreams won the Governor General's Award in 2006 and is published in 9 languages. The New York Times called his second novel, The O'Briens, "a major achievement" and Megan O'Grady, writing in Vogue, calls Carry Me, his latest novel, “another meditation on history and destiny . . . that make[s] the past feel stunningly close at hand.” Carry Me won The Vine Award for Canadian Jewish Literature. ("Behrens is a master, at home in the broad sweep of history and the intimate detail of a character’s experience. This is a novel that could be, should be, read in a hundred years." —The Jury ) The novels are being developed as features and as series. A native of Montreal and alumnus of Concordia, Behrens held a Wallace Stegner Fellowship at Stanford University and was a 2016 Fellow of Harvard's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
