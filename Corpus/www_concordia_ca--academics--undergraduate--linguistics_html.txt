Why study Linguistics?
Have you ever wondered why we don't all speak the same language? Or why different people have different accents?
Explore the human mind and discover the internal systems that govern the way language works. Develop strong problem-solving and analytical skills as you investigate properties of the mind by means as varied as computer analysis of speech and deciphering ancient texts.
Marvel at a child’s ability to effortlessly develop the very complex system that is human language. Trace the connections between languages spoken thousands of years ago and their living descendants. You’ll discover that languages that sound very different actually have a lot in common — just like humans.
