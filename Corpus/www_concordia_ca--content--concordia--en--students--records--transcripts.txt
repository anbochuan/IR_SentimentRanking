Transcripts
Transcripts
The Transcripts Department is a unit of the Registrar’s Office at Concordia University that manages official transcripts and related documents for current and past Concordia students.
We will provide official records to you, or other universities and institutions, quickly and efficiently.
Please contact us for any questions you may have.
Official transcripts
An official transcript is a complete academic record bearing the University seal and signature of the Registrar. An official transcript includes all courses followed at Concordia (with the exception of courses taken at the Centre for Continuing Education). The official transcript is issued in its entirety.
Students and alumni may request to receive their Complete Undergraduate/Graduate transcript or their Graduate Studies only transcript.
Other academic records
The transcripts department can also provide you with Undergraduate Course Descriptions.
Although we often receive requests for documents related to academic programs at Concordia, we cannot always provide them — but we will always direct you to someone who can help.
