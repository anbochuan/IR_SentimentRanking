We are pleased to announce the launch of our brand new website!
After months of hard work and dedication, we are delighted to officially announce the launch on August 20, 2015. The new site launch is now available and the URL is classifieds.csu.qc.ca
Our goal with this new website is to provide students an easier way find apartments, rooms and jobs and other goods and services. Highlights include: a more user-friendly interface that clearly lists all of the requirements to post ads, the ability to upload larger pictures, a more integrated mapping system to show where apartments are located, and more efficient ways to communicate with the HOJO staff to resolve any issues that may arise.
We hope you find the new website with its fresh look and easy to access information helpful and we also wish to establish this portal as a source of information for those who visits our site. For information on housing and employment rights check out our sister site: hojo.csu.qc.ca
