Martial arts
Martial arts
From Chi Kung to Tai Chi, Concordia Recreation offers a wide variety of martial art classes to choose from. While each form has its unique facets and qualities, rest assured your martial art experience will evoke the basic tenants of the art form - discipline, perseverance, honour and respect.
Classes offered
Chi Kung (Qi Gong)
Qi Gong is a truly ancient class of Chinese practice and exercise. Qi Gong means work with breath. There are probably a thousand kinds of Qi Gong actually practised in China.  The most popular are health Qi Gong and religious Qi Gong, followed by martial arts Qi Gong, medical Qi Gong, and longevity Qi Gong.  Some kinds of Qi Gong involve meditation and simple breathing while others involve energy circulation as well as breathing for power and ability.
Here at Concordia, a 50 minute course of Qi Gong is offered once a week on Wednesday mornings.  The idea is to give students an opportunity to practise a therapeutic exercise system that will boost energy and reduce stress.  No memorization is required.  The class is designed as a practice session, not an instructional class.  This way, every time a student attends, the benefits will be had, no one will ever fall behind and every class will fit lightly into every schedule.
Four kinds of Qi Gong will be practised, two from health Qi Gong and two from martial arts.  All four function to open the body, promote fitness, deepen the breath, tone the mind, lighten the spirit, and make people feel better generally.  The effect of each class lasts about two days, but are also cumulative.  At the end of the term, some noticeable positive effects will be felt by regular attendee.
Many different motivations bring people to Qi Gong: treating fatigue, depression, low energy, seeking sharper intelligence, meaning, or better character.  All these, and many more are good motivations to practice Qi Gong, not forgetting of course, the desire to get a good jump at the beginning of the day!
Iaido
IAIDO - In the traditional sense, Iaido is the Japanese martial art associated with the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard, striking or cutting an opponent, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard. New students of iaido start learning with a wooden sword (bokuto) and as they progress in their training, they advance to the use of an unsharpened sword (iaito). Advanced practitioners use a sharpened metal sword (shinken). The style of iaido taught at Concordia is called “Muso Shinden Ryu”.
Because iaido teaches the use of actual metal weaponry, with its inherent risk, it is almost entirely based on the teaching of forms, or kata. Iaido does not include direct contact or sparring of any kind. Because of this non-competitve aspect, and iaido's emphasis on precise, controlled, fluid motion, it is sometimes referred to as "moving Zen."
Jiu-Jitsu (Brazilian)
Is a sport, self-defense system and fitness program.  It relies on leverage and technique, rather than strength and size.   The techniques include grappling and  ground fighting with the goal of getting into position to force an opponent to submit. It is an intense aerobic and anaerobic workout that enhances flexibility, strength, cardiovascular fitness and muscular endurance.  it is a lifestyle that improves the whole person. The physical, mental, and transcendent benefits of jiu jitsu are accessible to everyone, from beginner to world-class competitor.
Karate (JKA Shotokan)
Meaning 'Empty Hands' is a Japanese martial art which teaches unarmed self-defense techniques, blocking and counterattacking. A highly dynamic and physical art, the Japanese Karate Shotokan style is taught by qualified instructors from the Japan Karate Association.  Students pass through several levels of expertise, with each level developing new skills combining the fundamental aspects: Basics, Kata (choreographed series of movements) and Kumite (sparring). Loose clothing, bare feet and a willingness to embrace Japanese fighting traditions is all that is needed for your participation
Kendo
Kendo- literally means "The way of the Sword" in Japanese. It refers to the art of traditional Japanese fencing that was originally developed and practiced by Bushi or Samurai. Kendo originated from the various sword fighting techniques resulting from hundreds of years of combat and study.
It deals with the physical and mental skills necessary for sword fighting. The goal of Kendo is not only to develop the physical capability for fighting but also the moral and spiritual aspects that may be applied in coping with real life. In Japan, it is one of the most popular martial arts. The practitioner is taught skills in attack and defence involving foot and hand movements usually with a partner wearing armour. Kendo has spread to other parts of the world such as North America and Europe. It has developed a strong following in Canada and in Quebec as well. Kendo is continually growing in popularity worldwide.
The Concordia University Kendo Club reached an impressive goal when it participated on May 5 in the Granby Taikai, a regional spring tournament with approximately 100 kendo practitioners from the strongest dojos in Quebec.
Concordia Shidokan brought the largest and loudest contingent of fighters and supporters with seven competitors in the Kyu division, two participants in the 1dan-2dan division, four club members in the 3dan-and-up division and four competitors in the women’s division.
Increased intensity and focus on training the last few months showed in the performances. With better control of the situation, competitors were able to better focus during key moments and achieve more precise strikes.
In the end, the club improved on previous results by capturing both silver and bronze in the Kyu division, silver in the 1dan-2dan division and the fighting spirit award in the women’s division. As well, the B team came close to eliminating two strong A teams. The most important accomplishment was the capturing of the gold medal and the Winners’ Cup by the Concordia A team.
The team final was very close, and after a win in the fifth match the overall score remained tied. After 10 minutes of nail-biting action and suspense, Hai Tao Yan was able to score the winning point in the sudden-death tie-breaker.
The participants would like to thank Santoso Sensei, club captain Tae Kyu Kim and acting captain Hai Tao Yan.
Kickboxing
Try Savate Kickboxing for fitness, competition or just for fun. We have entry level classes that are safe and enjoyable. We will teach you the skills you need to progress into one of our more challenging advanced classes. This kickboxing art involves a combination of effective hand strikes and dynamic kicks.

Savate uses the hands and the whole shoe as a weapon for striking with force, finesse and precision. The training sessions rely on partner drills, using controlled contact on each other, allowing the student to develop their balance, distance, precision and timing. This art is becoming more popular with women as it is graceful and elegant; however, with its powerful variety of kicks, punches, and sweeps, Boxe Francaise Savate is an effective sport fighting system.
