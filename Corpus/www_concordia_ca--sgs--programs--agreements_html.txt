Joint PhD / cotutelle program
A cotutelle refers to an agreement on joint supervision between two universities at the doctoral level. It allows the students to get a double / joint PhD degree delivered and recognized by both institutions.
Full-time doctoral students can take advantage of an exceptional opportunity to earn a joint PhD degree while developing strong connections with international partners. Through the cotutelle program, PhD candidates work in collaboration with distinguished faculty members from Concordia and an international partner university to produce an original thesis.
