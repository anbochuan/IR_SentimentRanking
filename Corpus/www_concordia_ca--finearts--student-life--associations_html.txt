Whatever your  interests, there is sure to be a related student association or club. From animation, cinema and ceramics, to printmaking, electroacoustics and theatre, the Fine Arts Student Alliance (FASA) has you covered. You never know – a chance encounter could open the door to an artistic collaboration!
FASA is the umbrella organization representing all students enrolled in courses in the Faculty of Fine Arts, and also administers all Fine Arts clubs. FASA supports student endeavour in the Fine Arts by issuing special project grants to individual and group applicants twice per year and by providing operational funding to student clubs and organizations.
