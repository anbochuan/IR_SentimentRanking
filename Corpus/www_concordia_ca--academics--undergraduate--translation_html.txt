Why study Translation?
The more interconnected the world becomes, the more it needs translators: people with quick, inquisitive minds and intercultural expertise that enables them to work in diverse situations.
To become a translator, you must start with an excellent knowledge of French and English. We’ll help you master your primary language and establish a thorough command of your second language.
Then, you choose from one of two streams: if your primary language is English, you learn to translate from French to English. If your primary language is French, you translate from English to French. In addition to translation courses, you take language and literature courses to sharpen your language skills and acquire a high level of proficiency in reading and writing.
Our program is officially recognized by the Canadian Association of Schools of Translation and is accredited by l'Ordre des traducteurs, terminologues et interprètes agréés du Québec (OTTIAQ).
