NEW! Weekly Tuesday Sexually Transmitted Infections testing clinic at Health Services
Regular sexually transmitted infection testing is an important part of taking care of your health
September 4, 2017 – December 4, 2017, 1 p.m. – 3:40 p.m.
STI testing is recommended for everyone who is sexually active, every 6-12 months. Are you up-to-date? If not, call 514-848-2424 ext. 3565 to book your appointment at Health Services' weekly STI testing clinic, Tuesdays 1:00 p.m.-3:40 p.m.
These clinics are offered to Concordians who have no symptoms of an STI; If you are experiencing any
which you think might be related to an STI, come to Health Services'
at 9 a.m. to see a doctor.
Health Services is offering these appointments to make it easier for Concordians to get these very important tests. If this time spot doesn't work for you, you can always drop in during our opening hours to meet with a nurse.
