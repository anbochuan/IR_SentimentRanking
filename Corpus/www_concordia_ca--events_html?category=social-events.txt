Come unwind before finals with fellow students over some tasty snacks (bonus points if they’re holiday specialties!) and stories. Snacks n’ Stories is a casual evening to celebrate celebrations, get to know each other

Bring a vegetarian item* (if you can) or just bring your best stories.

Join us for our monthly Day of Action at the MFSC. We’ll be making cookies again (they were too much of a hit not to!) along with sandwiches, then heading out to feed the needy.
This time we’ll also be thinking about food and spirituality. What do the different spiritual traditions have to say about feeding others and the needy? How do they express it? Come learn, get inspired and share your own wisdom and thoughts!
