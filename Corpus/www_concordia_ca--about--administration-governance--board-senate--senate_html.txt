Senate

Senate is the senior academic body and establishes procedures for the governance of its own affairs. It derives its powers from the Board of Governors and, subject to the latter's over-arching authority, has the final authority in all matters pertaining to the academic regulations and programs of the University. Its powers and functions are listed under article 70 of the By-Laws. Senate is composed of 53 voting members and 10 non-voting members, as outlined in article 61 of the By-Laws.
Meetings, minutes, and standing committees
Senate meets monthly from September to May, although the President and Vice-Chancellor, in consultation with the Steering Committee, may decide to dispense with a regular meeting.
The Agenda and documents are posted before the Senate meeting, while the Minutes of past meetings are maintained by the Records Management and Archives Department.
Senate conducts its business through its standing committees that report to Senate at regularly scheduled meetings.
Senator's Handbook
The information regarding the Senate operating procedures together with other information relevant to members of Senate is included in the Senator's Handbook.
Faculty and School Councils
The academic affairs of the Faculties (Arts and Science, Engineering and Computer Science, Fine Arts and John Molson School of Business) and the Schools (Graduate Studies and Continuing Education) are conducted by their respective Faculty or School Councils which report to Senate in accordance with the powers set out in their respective mandates.
