Neuromyths I: Don't Believe Everything You Hear
November 24, 2017, 5 p.m. – 6:15 p.m.
Chloe Soutar is a PhD candidate working in Hans Dringenberg’s lab in the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queen’s University. Chloe’s doctoral research centres on investigating the mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity and learning in the mammalian brain and the role of brain-generated estradiol as a modulator of synaptic activity, plasticity and learning.
In addition to her research activities, Chloe works to improve research skills and scientific literacy in students through educational outreach at the secondary school level. In 2017, she founded the non-profit research skills education program RISE: Research and Information Science Education.
At the Convergence Sci-Art/Art-Sci Conference Series, Chloe will discuss the latest neuroscience studies on whether the brain is sexually dimorphic (male-female differences) and the limits of human brain capacity (how much we use, and if we can improve our brains either through training or use of pharmacological compounds).
The Convergence Sci-Art/Art-Sci Conferences Series are conferences showcasing the work of scientists and artists in the crossover of disciplines between the science and the arts, or between the arts and the sciences. They are a partnership between Convergence, Perceptions of Neuroscience, Concordia University's Faculty of Fine Arts (FoFA), the Brain Repair and Integrative Neuroscience Program (BRaIN) and the Canadian Association for Neuroscience (CAN/ACN).
