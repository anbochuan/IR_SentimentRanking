I
received a BA (Honours) in Psychology
from York
University, Toronto in 1974
and an MA in Psychology
(Developmental)
from the University of Western
Ontario
in 1977. My MA program included a specialization
in early childhood education and I spent many
hours working in the University Laboratory Nursery
School under the supervision of Dr. Mary
J. Wright.
Following the MA I spent
five long years living
in Edmonton,
Alberta. I worked as an Assistant
Supervisor, Edmonton Northwest Day Care Center,
which was a municipally funded day care center.
I also completed a post-degree program in Elementary
Education at the University of Alberta
and after
two years of teaching I
received my professional
certification
as an elementary school teacher.
During
one year I was a counsellor in an elementary
school and in the second year, I taught a special
education class. Subsequently I attended the
University
of Waterloo and completed my
Ph.D. in Developmental
Psychology in
1986. I have been a member of the
Education Department, Concordia, ever since. In
1998 I was a visiting scholar at Lancaster University,
England.

Research interests and current projects
Co-construction
of meaning in the sibling relationship: Beginning with my dissertation, my
research
has been concerned with the
longitudinal nature
of the quality of
sibling relations, the influence
of
the mother on the children's relationship
and self_disclosure between siblings. Furthermore,
I am interested in how siblings co-construct
meaning in their relationship through play,
caretaking, teaching and use of
internal state
language (i.e.,
references to emotional, mental
states). Recently my work has focussed on young
children's social knowledge and understanding
of the sibling relationship, particularly within
the pretend play context. Currently I am
examining
the relations between
children pretense negotiations
and
conflict resolution, as well as the development
of intersubjectivity in sibling play and associations
with the quality of the relationship.
Another
project is investigating the
associations between
disclosure,
intimacy, and the quality of children
peer relationships in middle childhood. My current
SSHRC-funded project is to examine sibling teaching
from a social-constructivist framework.
Influence of the design of dramatic play
centers on children's play: How the ecology of the early childhood classroom,
specifically dramatic play centers, affects
children's social and cognitive play.
This project
has both a theoretical
and applied focus. Based
on theory
regarding the importance of pretend
play in young children's development, I have
conducted a series of studies to determine how
to facilitate opportunities for dramatic play
in the early childhood classroom. Several of
my MA students have investigated
other aspects
of play, such as the
relationship between solitary
play
and children thinking styles or the influence
of different kinds of play materials (e.g.,
superhero or scripted toys) on children.
Child care: Specifically recent
child care research and implications for Canadian
public policy. The majority of recent research
on child care emanates from the United
States,
however the Canadian context
differs from the
American in
significant economic and philosophical
ways. My work (with E. Jacobs) has pointed to
the importance of considering these differences
for the development of child care policy.
Professor
Jacobs and I are currently
engaged in a pan-Canadian
study of
curriculum in child care settings funded
through Human Resources Development Canada.
Specifically we are looking at provincial regulations
and guidelines for curriculum in child care
settings and how curriculum is taught
to future
educators enrolled in
community colleges. We
will also
conduct an inservice intervention
program focused on constructivist curriculum
for child care workers in three provinces (Manitoba,
Nova Scotia, Quebec). Finally, I have co-edited
a book (with L. Prochner) titled
Early Childhood
Care and Education in
Canada, which includes
historical
developments, current trends, and
future directions in Canadian early childhood
education.
