Research
Learning and memory, electrophysiology, neocortex, hippocampal formation, synapse
Overview: I use a variety of electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques to examine how short- and long-term alterations in the strength of synapses occur, and how these changes may contribute to learning and memory within cortical circuits.
A new memory requires the formation of a memory trace, or "engram", in the brain. First, the hippocampus and other nearby cortical areas are thought to integrate sensory inputs into a cohesive representation. Then, memory is stored more permanently through connections with other parts of the brain including the neocortex. A major mechanism through which circuits of the brain can learn is through long-lasting increases (or decreases) in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. My lab examines how changes in synaptic strength occur in parahippocampal and neocortical regions of the rat. Electrophysiological recording techniques are used to monitor synaptic strength and to examine how neuromodulatory systems (cholingergic, dopaminergic) and rhythmic EEG activities control changes in how neurons interact with one another.
Both graduate and undergraduate students make important contributions to this research. Please contact me if you are interested in conducting an Honours thesis, Specialization project, or Science College project in the lab.

Biography
Andrew Chapman obtained his B.Sc. in Psychology from the University of Toronto after having worked in the lab of John Yeomans. His graduate work with Ron Racine at McMaster University (1995) focused on factors that regulate changes in the strength of synapses in the entorhinal cortex and in the sensorimotor cortex of awake animals. He then moved to the Universite de Montreal to conduct postdoctoral work with Jean-Claude Lacaille, and used intracellular recordings from individual neurons in acute brain slices to investigate synaptic alterations and rhythmic activity in hippocampal inhibitory interneurons. Andrew joined the Department of Psychology at Concordia University in 1999, became Associate Professor in 2004, and Professor in 2013.
