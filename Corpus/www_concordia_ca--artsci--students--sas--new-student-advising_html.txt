New student advising
New student advising
Welcome new students! Advising is REQUIRED for new students, and must be done before registering. The type of advising depends on your department or college. Below you'll find information about the type of your advising depending on your department.
You must either contact your department for advising or watch a registration video in your portal. For departments with video advising, it is strongly recommended that you contact the department directly as well.
