The provisional minimum acceptance score for the Internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL iBT) for admission into a graduate program for students whose first language is not English and/or who have not received a substantial amount of their education in English is 85, with a minimum of 20 in each section. In all cases, Concordia reserves the right to require proof of English proficiency when such proof is deemed necessary. (Concordia will accept test results for the paper-based TOEFL if they are less than 2 years old). The minimum required score for the paper-based TOEFL is 563. The IELTS (International English Language Testing System) requires a minimum Band score of 6.5. Individual programs may require a higher score. Applicants should check their prospective program's requirements.
In addition to the general admission requirements, the Faculty may require applicants to write the Engineering Writing Test (EWT) as a condition of admission to all graduate programs in Engineering and Computer Science. Depending on the result, students may be required to complete remedial English language courses in addition to their program requirements.
