DPrint - self serve (students)
DPrint - self serve (students)
Through the DPrint service, Xerox was selected to install and service multifunction printer/scanner/photocopier devices for use across both the downtown and Loyola campuses. 50 self-serve machines are installed in public areas for use by the Concordia community as a whole. The goal of DPrint is to reduce paper waste, simplify printing, and offer consistent, high quality services across the university.  Users of the self-serve machines are required to load funds onto their student or employee card to gain access to printing, copying, or scanning services. Once funds have been added to the account, the user simply swipes their student ID card through the card reader attached to the machine they wish to use.

DPrint devices: Ensure that you are swiping your card correctly. Swipe your student ID card as pictured on the example above the card reader (picture facing away and down, back of card facing you with rectangular boxes facing upward).
If you are swiping your student ID card correctly and the loader or DPrint device will not read it, your student ID card may be damaged and need to be replaced.
Lost, stolen, or damaged cards can be replaced for a small fee at Birks Student Services (S-LB-185).
Once you receive your new ID card, DPrint needs to transfer any balance from your old card. This can be done at Campus Corner (S-LB 119) or transfers are done automatically after 24 hours.
Yes, you can still use the DPrint system even if it does not read your student ID card:
Loader: enter the 12-digit number found below the picture on your student ID and press ‘ENT’.
DPrint devices: Press keyboard access then use your MyConcordia netname and password (enter your netname where it says PIN).
To add funds at the DPrint Loaders:
Enter your staff ID number or loader PIN (7-digits, ex. 0123456).
Press the ‘ENT’ button.
Follow the on-screen instructions to add funds.
To use the self-serve DPrint devices:
Press ‘Keyboard Access’ on the touch screen.
In the PIN field, type your netname and press enter.
In the password field, type your password and press enter.
Once logged in, follow the copying/printing instructions posted on the device.
Printing
Print jobs can be submitted from library and lab computers or by using
from your personal laptop.
You can choose from two different printer options:
1) For black and white printing, select the ‘Mono’ print option from the computer
2) For colour printing, choose ‘WC_Colour’ print option from the computer
If you send a print job to a black and white device, it will not appear on a colour device, and vice versa.
Note: if you send a print job using the Mono print option, you can only print in black and white. If you send a print job using the WC_ Colour print option, you can choose to print in colour or black and white by selecting the ‘Force Monochrome’ box on the touch screen.
A sign on the top of each device identifies them as colour or black and white. A full list of DPrint self-serve devices can be found in the documentation section of this page.
It is likely that you are trying to retrieve your print job from a type of device that does not match the printing option that you selected (colour vs. black and white). Check both types of machines to locate the file you wish to print.
For WebPrint, there is a 2-step approval process; once when you submit the file, and once to approve the file. If you have missed one of the approvals, your job will not appear in your queue.
Make sure that you have sufficient funds for the print request. When you select a print job, the page count and total cost will appear in the window on the top right of the touch screen. If the cost of your job exceeds your account balance, the job will not print. This will be displayed as a cost of $0.00
If you’ve sent a print job in a paper size that is not Letter (8.5’x11’), Legal (8.5’x14’), or Ledger (11’x17’) then the print job will be held with an error message stating ‘Job held. Needs resources’. You will need to resend the job and select one of the accepted paper sizes.
The file/drivers may be corrupt. Delete the job from your queue and resend it from a different computer.
Copying
The simplest way is to use the ‘book copying’ function.
Select the ‘copy’ icon.
Select the ‘layout adjustment’ tab.
Select ‘book copying’.
Select the style you want (both sides, left or right).
The instructions on screen will display the proper way to place the book.
If you want both sides (left and right) on one sheet you can use the ‘custom scan’ area functions.
Select the ‘copy’ icon.
Select ‘auto reduce/enlarge’.
Select ‘output paper size’ and single (1-1) or double (2-2) sided option.
Select the ’layout adjustment’ tab, then original size, custom scan area and enter the opened book dimensions as a measurement in inches X and Y.
Save the settings and begin copying.
This will need to be adjusted for each different sized book.
It is likely that you have your original on the wrong corner of the glass. Always orient your original to the corner of the glass with the green arrow.
Place the original face down on the glass (corner with green arrow) and cover it with a sheet of blank paper. The devices will automatically detect the original size to be the same as the cover sheet.
Yes, and there are two ways to do this:
1) Use the document feeder on the top of the device. It will automatically compile a multiple-page document.
2) Use the ‘Build Jobs’ function, available under the ‘Job Assembly’ tab on the touch screen.  Turn ‘Build Job’ on and copy your documents, then select ‘Finish Job’.
Scanning
It is likely that you have your original on the wrong corner of the glass. Always orient your original to the corner of the glass with the green arrow.
Yes, and there are two ways to do this:
1) Use the document feeder on the top of the device. It will automatically compile a multiple-page scan file to send to your email.
2) Use the ‘Build Jobs’ function, available under the ‘Job Assembly’ tab on the touch screen.  Turn ‘Build Job’ on; scan your documents, then select ‘Finish Job’.
Note: there is a 10MB limit when sending a file to your email. This roughly corresponds to 100 pages of black and white text. If you are scanning at a higher resolution or scanning colour documents, the page count will be lower. To avoid reaching the 10MB limit, try sending several smaller files.
The scan will be sent to the email address associated with your MyConcordia portal. Note: Gmail is the preferred address due to others (Hotmail, MSN, and Yahoo) blocking scans as SPAM.
