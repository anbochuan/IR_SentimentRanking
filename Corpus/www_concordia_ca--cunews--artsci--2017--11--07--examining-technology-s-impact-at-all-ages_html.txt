Technology is ubiquitous. But what impact does it have, especially on young people?
That’s the focus of
research.
Cucinelli is an Assistant Professor in the Educational Technology Program in the
at Concordia University, and the co-director of the
for Concordia University's .
Her research-creation program has been focusing on the social, cultural and educational impacts of technology, specifically in K-12 schools and in the lives of young people.
So far, Cucinelli’s research has found there is a general lack in policy and guidelines surrounding how technology is used and integrated in schools.
“My most recent project examined cellphones in k-12 schools and we generally found a lack of support for teachers and administrators in k-12 schools when dealing with cell phones in their schools,” says Cucinelli.
Cucinelli’s interest in all things technology-related started in high school, where she was fortunate enough to have taken media classes. This continued through to her doctoral studies, where she examined how at-risk youth engaged with digital devices as a form of empowerment.
In addition to her focus on youth and technology, Cucinelli’s research interests extend to digital media theory, media activism and ageing and technology. As a co-applicant on , Cucinelli is helping to conduct research on how technology is experienced as one ages in a networked society.
Cucinelli, herself a Concordia grad, chose the university because of its reputation for innovation and creativity, and for thinking outside the box.
“There are exciting and innovative research and teaching opportunities here at Concordia that you don’t really see elsewhere,” says Cucinelli. “The way the university supports and celebrates research-creation in humanities was and still is very important for me. You simply do not see that in other universities.”
