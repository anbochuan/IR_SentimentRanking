Equitas and academia
“Concordia was a natural choice to co-host, given our longstanding relationship with the university,” says Ian Hamilton, executive director of .
“Particularly relevant is the university’s
and its reputation for being actively engaged in supporting social justice and the work of community organizations.”
Hamilton says the numbers speak for themselves: more than 120 Concordia students, faculty and alumni have contributed to Equitas’ work and global impact over the years.
Share grassroots strategies and lessons learned
“Our goal is to gather practitioners, policy-makers, NGOs and academics around the same table to explore solutions to challenges related to diversity, inclusion, violence and extremism,” says Schmid, a member of the conference’s organizing committee.
Participants — especially practitioners — will be encouraged to share grassroots strategies and lessons learned in the field. Organizers plan to fully document the conference’s outcomes and post them online for free consultation.
The conference dovetails nicely with Concordia’s ongoing commitment to look outward, embracing societies’ current challenges.
“Students and researchers from multiple disciplines are doing innovative work on human rights,” says , dean of the .
“The conference will generate pertinent reflections on issues within the educational context with the collaboration of Equitas. Richard deserves much credit for bringing this event to Concordia.”
Mission critical
Schmid claims we need human rights education now more than ever.
“Like-minded people need to continue to get the truth, not fake news,” says the expert in educational technology.
He sees human rights education as “the long game” with no quick fix.
“We must work with, and within communities as partners in change. HRE sometimes requires the most difficult change of all, that of culture. Coming to understand and respect universal human rights can shape that transition.”
