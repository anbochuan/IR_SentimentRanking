Concordia has launched the largest fundraising campaign in its history. The Campaign for Concordia: Next-Gen. Now will raise $250 million to support the university’s ambition to rethink higher-education teaching and research.
The Campaign for Concordia places next-gen research, teaching and learning at the forefront of the university’s future.
“This campaign is about attracting world-class talent — and supporting the university as a world-class institution,” says Concordia President Alan Shepard. “We live in a time of rapid change, one that presents new challenges and possibilities. It’s our opportunity to lead in areas such as synthetic biology, cybersecurity, electronic textiles, digital inclusion and citizen engagement, and entrepreneurship — and to equip the next generation to prosper.”
From scholarships to research institutes and think tanks, the Campaign for Concordia will advance the university’s nine strategic directions. Learn more at .

“We are campaigning for the future of teaching and learning — initiatives our society needs in the face of major change and disruption. Never before have knowledge and education been so important for our society,” says Andrew Molson.
“By joining the Campaign for Concordia, we take pride in championing a cause of central importance to our society,” says Lino Saputo Jr. “Supporting education is a source of fulfillment. It is a way of helping students achieve their goals. Education contributes to society and tackles some of the biggest questions we face.”
According to rankings by the Times Higher Education, Concordia is among the top two per cent of universities in the world and number two in North America for universities under 50 years old. The Campaign for Concordia will support research and teaching that benefit the university’s 48,000 students, 7,000 faculty and staff and more than 200,000 alumni.
