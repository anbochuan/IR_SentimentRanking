Key priorities to broaden Concordia’s community and industry engagement, and move from ideas to impact
THINK TANKS
Our proposed think tanks will enable us to make a greater impact in effecting change to public policy. Our Think Tank on Global Mobility and Human Rights as well as our Think Tank on Engineering, Technology and Public Policy will provide reliable sources of knowledge and ideas to guide progress.
SOCIAL INNOVATION
Increasingly, approaches grounded in social innovation are offering powerful solutions to address societal problems. Through our social innovation network, we’re providing pathways and community partnerships for students and faculty to apply their knowledge to make a difference — in Montreal and beyond.
PUBLIC SCHOLARS
To bridge the gap between academic research and the general public, we inaugurated the Public Scholars Program for PhD students in fall 2016. Selected doctoral students received professional training to help them engage with the wider community. The initiative led to published op-eds, blog posts, public lectures and a variety of outreach efforts.
OPEN ACCESS
Quebec’s only open-access, non-profit scholarly publisher, Concordia University Press helps define our vision of what a university can and should be. Support for the press will enable the print or digital publication of engaging, accessible books in English and French spanning the arts, humanities and social sciences.
LIVING LABS
While a conventional lab might develop a product or idea behind closed doors, the living lab seeks to engage the community at every stage of development, from conception through to prototyping. To leverage our unique place in Montreal, we aim to create spaces that connect researchers with citizens, knowledge producers with knowledge users, and artists with audiences.
EXPERTS IN RESIDENCE
Professionals from outside a university environment bring new perspectives and vast practical experience that complement what students gain from academic work. They help us draw and reach new audiences through sold-out lectures, published articles and exhibitions.
INDIGENOUS SPACE
We are creating an Indigenous Cultural Centre — a physical community space that welcomes and connects Indigenous students, faculty and staff. The centre will host events that celebrate Indigenous cultures and welcome members of the larger Concordia community and the public.
RESEARCH SHOWROOM
Located on a busy intersection in downtown Montreal, 4th Space is a high-traffic, high-visibility space that will showcase the latest in Concordia research. This unique research production and dissemination environment will connect our university’s talent, creativity and know-how with the public.
KNOWLEDGE SHARING
The effort to translate particular knowledge to groups and individuals who stand to benefit most is paramount to our vision as a next-generation university. To maximize the impact and visibility of research in the social sciences and humanities, we’re putting together a knowledge mobilization team.
