Application tips
Apply early by gathering and composing the required documents for your application.
Select referees who can provide a strong recommendation and review with them the requirements of reference letters and academic assessment forms.
Ensure all required documents and information are submitted by the application deadline.
Write a statement of purpose describing, for example, your motivation, academic interests and professional goals.
Non-Canadian residents should apply for the Certificat d'acceptation du Quebec (CAQ) and a Canadian study permit as soon as you receive your offer of admission.
