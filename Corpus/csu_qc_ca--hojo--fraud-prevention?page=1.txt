We take fraud very seriously.  If you have received suspicious emails via our online classifieds site, please contact  immediately.  Specific types of emails to look out for include messages that request unnecessary personal information (bank account number, home address, etc.), where a stranger is in need of your help and emails that state you have won a prize or award.  Please forward the message you received when you email us.
Also note that our services are completely free, and if someone approaches you and asks for a fee to access these, contact  immediately.
