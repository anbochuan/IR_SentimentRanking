Why pursue a Graduate Diploma in Community Economic Development?
The need to develop effective social policies, programs and communities with the power to confront complex challenges has never been more urgent. As we continue to witness large-scale climate change, as well as political and economic crises worldwide, we require scholars and community sector professionals to reflect on how they can contribute to progressive change and lead projects that inspire civic engagement.
The Graduate Diploma in Community Economic Development provides you with an environment to investigate Quebec and Canada’s social and solidarity economy in a broader context. Our
are actively involved in the community and social economy sector, allowing you to benefit from their scholarship and practical knowledge as you explore the evolution of community economic development, community organizing and different theories of economic change. In today’s context this includes the new and growing interest in social innovation as it generates uncharted paths for community based social and economic transformation.
Our diverse student body is comprised of community sector professionals and students with volunteer experience in a variety of organizations. Many courses in our curriculum are participatory and enriched by the collective experiences of our cohort.  Montreal’s own history of community-based activism and economic development will serve as a backdrop as you participate in a field project with a community organization.

You will dedicate between 80 to 120 hours to a field project that addresses an aspect of community development. This field project can be based within your present work, new paid work or in a new or current volunteer context.
The project is an opportunity for you to address a specific challenge you are passionate about and which is also seen as important by the collaborating organization. You are responsible for defining, finding and negotiating your field project, with the support and assistance of our program. You will critically analyze your project and submit a written report that summarizes and evaluates your experience.
Examples of recent past field projects include students collaborating with groups on issues related to immigration, housing, urban agriculture, youth etc. Students are responsible for negotiating the tasks within the field placement with the organization based on organizational needs and student learning interests. Running a conference, providing training, facilitating workshops, supporting inter-organizational collaborations, doing research are examples of tasks that students have taken on as part of their field placement.
