Dr.
Cardoso (PhD McGill) joined the
TESL Centre, Department
of Education at
Concordia University in 2003 after
completing his PhD at McGill University in theoretical
linguistics (specialization in phonology and
sociolinguistics).
His main research
interest is to explore how the
broad
insights provided by theoretical phonology
and sociolinguistics can be applied to the investigation
of the variable patterns that characterize the
speech of English learners. His most
recent publications
involve the
investigation of domain-driven and
sociolinguistic variation in Picard and Brazilian
Portuguese from an Optimality Theoretical perspective.
He also teaches Phonology, Computers in
Language
Learning, and Methodology:
Reading and Writing,
and has taught
courses in theoretical and applied
linguistics for both the Department of Linguistics
at McGill University, as well as the Department
of Foreign Languages at Universidade Federal do
Pará (Brazil). His teaching career also
includes
several years of ESL/EFL and
Portuguese teaching
in Canada and in
his native Brazil. Outside of
academia,
he also writes about audio equipment
for a specialized Brazilian magazine, works as
a consultant for Lexicon Branding in the design
and evaluation of brand names for adoption in
the Brazilian market, practices his clarinet,
and experiences other worlds in the form
of music,
poetry and cinema.
