Why pursue a Diploma in Enivronmental Assessment?
The Diploma is a course-based program that is directed towards individuals interested in developing their knowledge and skills in the environmental assessment field. It is also directed towards individuals presently working in this field who would like to upgrade their skills.
The Diploma in Environmental Assessment has been designed to fulfill three objectives:
to develop a sound understanding of the processes and methodologies of EA;
to expose students to the range of broad public policy and social science considerations involved in environmental planning, sustainable development and resource decision-making; and
to enhance students' existing knowledge of the biogeophysical environment.
The Diploma is directed towards individuals who hold an undergraduate degree and are interested in developing or enhancing their knowledge and skills in the environmental field. The program will be offered over two semesters (fall and winter). To meet the schedule of those in the work force, many courses will be offered in the evening.
