Technology Sandbox
LB-211.00 #CUsandbox
Now open
It's a place for the Concordia community to try out emerging technologies
and cutting-edge equipment. Learn about 3D printing, electronics, or digital
music by attending a workshop. Work on your personal tech project,
explore virtual reality with headsets we provide, or tell our digital die cutter to print your vinyl decal.
It's a community technology space where everyone can learn by doing, by making, by
playing, and by sharing knowledge with each other.
