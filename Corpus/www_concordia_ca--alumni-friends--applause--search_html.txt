Filmmaking and the tradition of excellence
Award-winning filmmaker Louise Archambault, BFA 93, MFA 00, began her career in the Quebec film industry holding a variety of posts, including still photographer, line producer and assistant director.
She started work on her own creations in the late 1990s while completing a graduate degree at the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema. Her artistic vision materialized through a steady output of short documentary and fiction films.
One of these, Atomic Saké (1999), was awarded a Prix Jutra and Best Film at the Delle Donne International Film Festival. Familia (2005), her debut feature-length fiction film, was well received domestically and internationally. It won the City TV Award for Best Canadian First Feature Film and the Claude-Jutra Award for Best First Film.
Archambault’s brilliant foray into the world of commercial cinema was followed by Gabrielle (2013), a multi-award-winning production. A touching and mesmerizing film, it introduces the talented Gabrielle Marion-Rivard, a young actress and singer with Williams syndrome. Premiering at the Locarno International Film Festival, it received the Prix du Public. It won similar prizes at both the Festival International du Film Francophone de Namur and the Festival du film canadien de Dieppe.
Narrowly missing a nomination as Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards, Gabrielle received multiple awards at home: Best Picture and Best Actress at the Canadian Screen Awards. It won in five categories at the 16th Soirée des prix Jutra. (Meilleure réalisation, Meilleur montage, Meilleur scénario, Meilleure actrice de soutien, Film s’étant le plus illustré à l'extérieur du Québec).
“When you see a success like Louise Archambault’s Gabrielle …, it really inspires everyone here — students, staff and professors — to maintain that tradition of excellence,” said , chair of Concordia’s Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema.
Archambault is now working on After the End, an adaptation of a British play set in a nuclear bunker.

Honorary Life Membership – 2014
honorary life membership, award, David J. Azrieli
David J. Azrieli, C.M., C.Q., M.Arch., was born in Poland and came to Canada in 1954. He is now world-renowned as an innovative builder and designer. David graduated from Carleton University with a master’s degree in architecture in 1997, when he was 75 years old.
Azrieli was born in Poland in 1922. His parents, brother and sister were killed during the Holocaust. He fled Poland in 1939 and fought in Israel’s War of Independence in 1948 before settling in Montreal in 1954, where he made his fortune in real estate.
Renowned as an architectural innovator, Azrieli graduated from Carleton University with a master’s degree in architecture in 1997, when he was 75 years old.
He studied at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology from 1943 to 1946. Later, in Canada, he earned a Bachelor of Arts from Université de Montréal.
The second of four children, Azrieli was an ardent philanthropist. In 1989, he established the Azrieli Foundation — which supports education, medical research, Jewish appreciation and Holocaust commemoration — to realize his charitable goals.
The Azrieli Foundation donated $5 million to Concordia in 2011 to establish the Azrieli Institute of Israel Studies, a research hub that looks beyond the lens of Israeli politics. Norma Joseph, the institute’s associate director, says: “David was a builder. His vision as a philanthropist helped create institutions. We are indebted to him for his commitment to Israel studies and to Concordia.”
Azrieli also established the first endowed fellowships for Concordia graduate students. In 1984, he helped create the Azrieli Holocaust Collection, some 8,500 titles on anti-Semitism, at Concordia University Libraries. In 1975, Concordia bestowed an honorary doctorate upon Azrieli, calling him an “exemplary contributor” to the university.
Last year, Azrieli donated $560 million and Azrieli Group stock to his Azrieli Foundation. His family has given some $100 million in philanthropic funds over the past 23 years.
Azrieli’s financial success, much of it derived from his real estate acumen, fostered his love of Canada and devotion to Israel, where he thrived. “I have two homelands,” Azrieli once said, “two places I love and where I have been blessed to do what I love best. My opportunity to express myself professionally started in Canada and eventually let me fulfill my dream of making a contribution to my other homeland, Israel. The two have always been entwined.”
His deepest belief, as he once said, was that “genuine freedom is being able to do what you love to do. If you have to spend your life doing things you don’t love to do, you are no better than a slave. This then, is my message: do what you love to do.”
An avid reader of newspapers and lover of classical music, Azrieli was named to the Order of Canada in 1984. He was invested as a Chevalier of the Ordre National du Québec in 1999.
David Azrieli died on July 9, 2014. He was 92 years old and is survived by his wife of 57 years, Stephanie, GrDip 76, BA 71, and by his children, Rafael, Sharon, an opera singer and cantor, Naomi, CEO of the Azrieli Foundation, and Danna, vice-president of the Azrieli Group.
Cert 92, BA 00, GrDip 11 Great Concordian
Making university possible
Brigeen Badour, BA 00, GrDip 11, has a knack for helping others – giving advice, volunteering her time and supporting Concordia students with her pocketbook.
A veteran Concordia staffer, she joined the university in 1985, working as a secretary in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. By 1987, she moved to the Centre for Mature Students — which later became the Student Transition Centre — where she soon found her vocation as an academic advisor.
Until she retired in 2013, she guided students along their academic path, helping them see their future more clearly, navigate through course selections, regulations and sometimes complex situations.
“With her enthusiasm and complete dedication to students, Brigeen embraced and exemplified the School of Extended Learning’s motto: ‘We make university possible,’” said Javier Lee, director of administration at Concordia’s John Molson School of Business.
“Not only was she knowledgeable about the university’s programs and the academic needs of students, she’s a great listener who would make every effort to understand the students’ needs, interests, goals, and expectations,” he added.
Without Badour’s guidance and assistance, many may not have enrolled at Concordia, let alone graduate.
“Brigeen went above and beyond,” said recent graduate Michael Daoussis. “I have never met such a kind, considerate and professional advisor in all my years.”
Many students and graduates have echoed these sentiments. “Every time I had an obstacle, Brigeen had a solution,” said alumna Manon Daisomont in an interview for Concordia’s Thursday Report in 2003.
In 2008, she co-organized Concordia’s Single Parents Support Network, which later became the Student Parents Centre
Badour has inspired others to contribute to Concordia in so many different ways. She brings out the best in her colleagues with her positive attitude and ready smile. She continually strives to advance the mission of Concordia, promoting the university and giving back.
In 2013, she funded the Pamela Badour Memorial Bursary — in the name of her late cousin — in support of undergraduate students who are also single parents.  She is a longtime donor to Concordia’s Community Campaign and spearheaded events with her colleagues to benefit the campaign.
Badour is a three-time Concordia graduate. As a mature student, she earned a certificate in arts and science in 1992, a BA in human relations in 2000 and a graduate diploma in adult education in 2011.
Despite her retirement, Badour couldn’t stay away from Concordia, so she works on a casual basis at the John Molson School of Business and School of Extended learning.
BA 93 Great Concordian
Maziar Bahari, Iran, communications, political science, Concordia University, documentary, Art of Demolition, Football Iranian Style, And Along Came a Spider, Mohammad and the Matchmaker, Targets: Reporters in Iraq, Iraq, Newsweek, Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, espionage, solitary confinement, torture, Free Maziar Bahari, New York Times, Then They Came for Me, The Guardian, The New Republic, Jon Stewart, journalism, The Daily Show, Gael García Bernal, Rosewater
Story of harrowing, 118-day capture adapted for big screen
Iranian-born Maziar Bahari, BA 93, moved to Canada in the late 1980s to undertake studies in communications and political science at Concordia University.
Soon after graduating, he embarked on a directing career. His filmography includes documentary works that offer all-too-rare glimpses into the lives and challenges of the Iraqi and Iranian peoples. They include Art of Demolition (1998), Football, Iranian Style (2001), And Along Came a Spider (2003), Mohammad and the Matchmaker (2004) and Targets: Reporters in Iraq (2007).
Bahari served as Newsweek’s Iran correspondent between 1998 and 2011. He was in Tehran during the 2009 civil uprising, which followed the disputed victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the presidential election. On June 21, Bahari was arrested and incarcerated under charges of espionage.
For 118 days, Bahari was held in solitary confinement, tortured and submitted to constant interrogation. The Free Maziar Bahari international campaign helped secure his release on bail at the end of October.
Bahari swiftly fled the country and reunited with his pregnant wife in London. He was subsequently tried in absentia and sentenced to thirteen and a half years in prison plus seventy-four lashes for crimes he did not commit.
Bahari retold his story in a New York Times bestseller titled Then They Came for Me. The Guardian described it as “a unique achievement.” The New Republic concurred: “An important and elegant book . . . a prison memoir enlarged into a family history.”
Bahari often thought of his father and sister while incarcerated — both suffered imprisonment in Iran decades earlier. He also drew on the knowledge he acquired as an undergraduate student to analyze his place of confinement and derail the process of interrogation.
His memoir is the subject of Rosewater, a movie directed by political satirist and television host Jon Stewart. Mexican actor Gael García Bernal will play Bahari.
“Maziar is an incredible person,” the actor told a group of students at Concordia during a 2013 visit to Montreal. He added: “It was the most incredible filming adventure I’ve ever put myself into.”

Honorary Life Membership – 2016
A love of philosophy, history and literature led Henry Beissel to initiate programs that eventually led to the founding of Concordia’s Liberal Arts College 36 years ago.
A distinguished professor emeritus, Beissel joined Sir George Williams University — one of Concordia’s two founding institutions — in 1966.
Concordia’s first rector, John O’Brien, asked Beissel to develop a creative writing program in the early 1970s. Beissel established and served as director of that program, which continues to flourish at both undergraduate and graduate levels to this day.
Throughout his academic career, Beissel wrote poems, plays and essays. His work Inuk and the Sun (1973) was featured at the Stratford Festival.

JMSB’s two-time Olympic champion
Alexandre Bilodeau is a shining star among Concordia University’s . The John Molson School of Business student made Canadians and Concordians proud at the Sochi Olympics in Russia, earning a second gold medal in mogul skiing.
The world champion successfully defended the title he had won at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, thereby becoming the first freestyle skier to stand twice on the highest level of the Olympic podium.
This was one of many firsts for Bilodeau who, at age 14, became the youngest athlete to perform a triple jump in competition. He started off as Rookie of the Year in 2006 and quickly collected victories at international ski events, including 19 World Cup gold medals and three World Championships in dual moguls.
Bilodeau retired from professional skiing after the 2014 World Cup season.
He has two heroes: his brother Frédéric, who is affected by cerebral palsy, and Jean-Luc Brassard, former Olympic freestyle ski champion.
Bilodeau has long been a spokesperson for — and a dedicated supporter of — many charitable organizations, including the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, the Cerebral Palsy Association of Alberta, the Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres for Cerebral Palsy Research and the Quebec Cerebral Palsy Association.
Now ready for a new challenge, Bilodeau is pursuing a bachelor’s degree in accounting. He has been studying intermittently, on a part-time basis, for several years. At a homecoming celebration Concordia held in his honour after his Sochi win, Bilodeau said it would have been impossible for him to reconcile his two lives —  athlete and accounting student — without the support of professors and administrators.
“Without John Molson [School of Business] or Concordia people, I would never have been able to do school and skiing. And I probably would’ve stopped skiing if I couldn’t have done both,” he . The two-time Olympic champion has many projects in mind, but his priority is to step back into the classroom and complete his degree. In his own words: “Now changing my goal, it’s something refreshing and I’ve been looking forward to it.”

Preventing genocide through research and advocacy
Genocide scholar Frank Chalk celebrates half a century at Concordia in 2014. After he arrived at Sir George Williams University — one of Concordia’s founding institutions — his speciality in American foreign policy and African history led him to examine the history of mass violence.
In 1980, he and sociology professor Kurt Jonassohn pioneered a full-year course on the history and sociology of genocide. Concordia then hosted the Montreal Inter-University Seminar on Mass Murder in History between 1982 and 1985.
The following year, Chalk and Jonassohn co-founded the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS), now a world-renowned research and advocacy organization. Its mission is to prevent mass atrocities through education, policy recommendations and the establishment of effective partnerships between key actors.
The pair published The History and Sociology of Genocide (Yale University Press, 1990), a field-defining work spanning Antiquity to the recent past.
Chalk is a widely published historian and a highly sought-after speaker who served as president for both the Canadian Association of African Studies and the International Association of Genocide Scholars.
A past Fellow of the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, he was also appointed a member of the Canadian Advisory Council of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
Chalk recently joined forces with now-retired Senator Roméo Dallaire, former U.N. force commander for the U.N. Assistance mission to Rwanda, to launch the MIGS-affiliated Will to Intervene project (W2I).
“W2I is research with a practical outcome, which is to teach advocates and opinion makers — NGOs, the media, faith communities, business, trade unions and legislatures — how to mobilize the top Canadian and U.S. political leaders to help prevent the next Rwanda,” he explained to .
Chalk co-authored Mobilizing the Will to Intervene (McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2010) a comparative analysis of American and Canadian policies towards Rwanda and Kosovo.
“Concordia is about innovation, new horizons and dreams that can come true — not just for students, staff and faculty — but for the sake of humanity,” Chalk said 10 years ago. Initiatives such as the MIGS and W2I are indications that the same holds true today.
Chalk is the recipient of a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012) and an Outstanding Faculty Award (2011) presented by the Concordia University Alumni Association.

Perfecting the craft of filmmaking
Award-winning filmmaker Yung Chang, BFA 99, directed two short films soon after graduating from Concordia’s Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema.
The Fish Market (2002), an independently produced fiction film, and Earth to Mouth (2003), a documentary produced by the National Film Board of Canada, paved the way to Chang’s first feature-length documentary.
His critically acclaimed Up the Yangtze (2007) offers a compelling portrait of the people whose homes were destroyed to make way for the construction of China’s Three Gorges Dam, a massive hydroelectric project.
The film won numerous Best Documentary awards at festivals around the world, including the 2008 San Francisco International Film Festival, the 2008 Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards and the 2009 Genie Awards. Up the Yangtze was also Grand Jury nominee for Best Documentary in the World Cinema competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.
Chang attributes part of his success to the engaging and rigorous education he received while in film school. He
his professors for taking “the onus off the idea of having to make it in Hollywood” and instilling value in the craft of filmmaking. “They encouraged us to define our own vision. That’s something I’ll never forget,” he adds.
In 2012, his film China Heavyweight premiered at the Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for Best Documentary in the World Cinema competition. It also won Best Feature Film at the Milano Film Festival and Best Documentary at the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards.
Chang’s third feature-length production, The Fruit Hunters (2012), is based on the bestselling book by Concordia alumnus Adam Leith Gollner, BA 04. The film won the Grand Prize at the 2013 Festival international du film d'environnement in Paris.
Chang is now set to revisit the language of fiction. He is currently writing the script of Eggplant, a feature-length story that revolves around a Chinese wedding photographer.

Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist
Barbara Davidson, BFA 90, knew by the age of 15 that she wanted to be photographer. She completed undergraduate work in fine art photography while snapping images for The Link, Concordia University’s student newspaper.
Davidson began her career at The Record, in Waterloo, Ontario, after receiving her degree. In 1995, she jumped on the opportunity to travel with the Red Cross to the Balkans, but circumstances resulted in her group being held hostage by a Serbian paramilitary group. Davidson’s experience in a war-torn and impoverished region proved life-changing.
Upon her return, she accepted a position at The Washington Times establishing her reputation in the field of photojournalism. She then worked at the Dallas Morning News before relocating to the West Coast where she joined the Los Angeles Times.
Davidson has since travelled around the world — to Afghanistan, China, The Congo, Iraq, Palestine, Rwanda, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Yemen to document humanitarian crises caused by armed conflicts and natural disasters.
Max Wallace, BA 90, aptly describes his former The Link colleague when he
that Davidson’s “calm demeanour in the face of danger has earned her a reputation as one of the world’s most respected photojournalists, and the laurels to go with it.”
Davidson won her first Pulitzer Prize in 2006 for her coverage of Hurricane Katrina. She had been named Newspaper Photographer of the Year a few months earlier at the Pictures of the Year International (POYI) competition. She replicated that feat in 2013 thanks to her ability to balance “powerful aesthetic with solid journalistic content.” By then, Davidson had earned multiple prizes, including a Visa d’Or Daily Press Award (2009), a National Press Photographers Association New America Award (2010) and a News and Documentary Emmy Award (2011).
She won a second Pulitzer Prize in 2011 with a series of photographs depicting innocent victims of Los Angeles’ gang violence. Davidson combines determination and compassion to give people a voice through her lens.
“The same thing holds true today as some 20 years ago when I worked at the student newspapers: It’s all about good storytelling. It’s all about having the passion to see those stories through,” she confided in a recent .

Stephanie Dotto is a 23-year-old, first-year Concordia student working toward her BA in Human Relations.
When she was in her last year at Beaconsfield High School in her native Kirkland, Que., Stephanie heard a presentation about making a difference in the world and decided that every child should have, at the very least, one pair of shoes. So Stephanie and a friend proceeded to collect more than 1,200 pairs of gently used shoes from local elementary schools and shipped them to needy children in Malawi, Africa.
At 17, Stephanie founded a charitable organization called It All Started with the Shoes. In the past six years the organization has raised funds--with the help of Montreal businesses, churches, schools, Girl Guide units and individual benefactors--to help build two Malawian schools, fix the roofs on two others, add a nutrition centre to a rural hospital and ship three containers full of essential supplies.
In March 2003, Stephanie made her first visit to Malawi to deliver medicine, school supplies and toys. Since then, she has been back three times and is now working on several other aid projects. Stephanie frequently speaks at Montreal-area schools and to community groups to raise awareness of Malawian living conditions. Next week, she is Malawi bound for the fifth time.

Concordia’s father of biology
Father Stanley Drummond began teaching at Loyola College in 1946. He was 33 years old and had just completed an MA thesis titled “Vascularity in the Brains of Summer and Hibernating Frogs” at the University of Toronto.
He had been ordained the year before and was now working towards completing both his Jesuit training and doctoral studies in biology.
Father Drummond’s first project upon joining Loyola College’s faculty was to develop research facilities for aspiring scientists and medical doctors. “The lab was practically a cupboard and in it we had 10 archaic microscopes, a model of a human heart and one of a human ear,” he told the Loyola Alumnus in 1971.
Father Drummond’s carpentry skills served him well — he designed and built the furniture needed to equip the Department of Biology he launched almost single-handedly in 1946. The “” pronounced his final vows five years later in the Loyola Chapel.
A caring and dedicated professor, Father Drummond remained in Montreal where he left a lasting impression on countless cohorts of students. Father Drummond defined his philosophy of education with the following triad: “Don’t lie. Admit mistakes. Be thoroughly honest with students.”
In 1995, the university’s founding father of biology received an Alumni Award for Excellence in Teaching. In 1996, he celebrated a half-century in the classroom — the year of Loyola College’s centennial.
Father Drummond died March 16, 2012, in the 99th year of his life.

“He combines the capacity to dream big dreams with the practical skills to ensure that they become reality,” said Michael Kenneally, principal and chair of Canadian Irish Studies, on November 1, 2010. That day, Gallery received an
in recognition of his outstanding contributions and ongoing dedication to Concordia.
The former mayor of Westmount graduated from Loyola College in 1957. He maintained contact with his alma mater partly through the alumni association of which he was the president in the early 1970s. In 2007, he organized the golden anniversary celebration of his graduating class and helped secure funding for what became the Loyola Class of ‘57 Bursary.
In 1995, Gallery co-founded the Canadian Irish Studies Foundation to support the study of Irish history and culture. Funds raised through the foundation contributed to the creation of several scholarships and the establishment of Concordia’s Centre for Canadian Irish Studies, now known as the School of Canadian Irish Studies.
For his role in building the School, the Concordia University Alumni Association presented Gallery with the Humberto Santos Award of Merit in 2010. Accolades also came from Canada’s Irish community: Gallery received the St. Patrick’s Society of Montreal Community Award (1997), was elected Montreal Irish Man of the Year (2000), and was made an Honorary Lifetime Member of the St-Patrick’s Society (2008).
More recently, Ray Basset, ambassador of Ireland to Canada, travelled to Montreal to meet Gallery and present him with a
in recognition of his “role in making Canadian Irish Studies at Concordia one of the pre-eminent academic centres in the world for the study of Ireland and the Irish Diaspora.”
Gallery is also the recipient of the Commemorative Medal for the 125th Anniversary of Confederation (1993) and the Queen’s Golden Jubilee Medal (2002).

Loyola Medal
Excerpt from the press release dated April 20, 1978:
Dr. Jacques Genest, renowned for his contributions to the study of high blood pressure, was awarded the Loyola Medal at a black tie dinner at the Engineers Club of Montreal.
The study of hypertension has come to be identified with Montreal-born Jacques Genest, director of Hotel-Dieu's Clinical Research Institute of Montreal. His studies documenting the inter-relationship between physiology and hypertension are recognized internationally as are his contributions to the broader issues of the social and ethical aspects of medical care.
Dr. Genest received his M.D. from the Université de Montreal and did post-graduate work at Hotel-Dieu in Montreal, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and the Rockefeller Institute and the Rockefeller Hospital for Medical Research in New York City.
Excerpt from Dr. Genest’s acceptance address:
It is with a deep sense of receiving a great honour that I accept the Loyola Medal for 1978. This pride is tempered by humility since I am sure all realize that any accomplishment, whether unique and very great or that of a lifetime, is rarely the product of a man alone but the consequence of many influences, including family upbringing, college and university training, the love and support of one's wife and family, and the help and advice of many friends, several of whom have done us the honour of their presence tonight, and of close and loyal collaborators.
My pride is therefore that of being the front man for a wonderful group to whom I owe so much.

Jesuit film scholar and peace advocate
Father Marc Gervais, BA 50, first visited France in the mid-1960s to complete his Jesuit tertianship. He travelled to the Riviera and attended his first Cannes Film Festival. Growing up in Sherbrooke, he had developed a passion for moving images, thanks to his grandmother who often took him to the cinema.
Father Gervais became a Cannes fixture over the years as he acquired notoriety as a film scholar. He joined Loyola College’s Communication Arts program in 1967, teaching film studies to enthused students, many of whom became accomplished writers and directors.
Father Gervais published seminal works on Pier Paolo Pasolini and Ingmar Bergman, sat on the juries of several international film festivals (Cannes, Oxford and Venice), served as commissioner for the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and acted as consultant on a number of films, including Black Robe (1991) and The Mission (1986). In 1996, Father Gervais told the Winnipeg Free Press that he nearly secured a role alongside Robert De Niro in the latter film. “For about three months, [the producers] wondered whether they were going to use me or an established actor. Alas, they chose Jeremy Irons, who was awfully good in it.”
In 2000, Father Gervais received the Cannes Festival Critics Award for nearly 40 years of contributions. The heavy plaque was “sort of saying thank you for being around this long,” he told the .
Father Gervais, in the opening pages of Ingmar Bergman: Magician and Prophet (1999), expresses his gratitude to generations of Concordia students who made “it all so meaningful, important and fun.” Adam Gollner, BA 04, remembers the Jesuit film scholar: “He believed that art’s main role is to connect us with the unseen. For him, watching film was the greatest form of prayer.”
Father Gervais discussed art, yet he spoke about the culture of peace through the Loyola Jesuit Institute for Studies in International Peace, which he helped establish in 1988. He retired in 2003 and spent his last days at the Jesuit Infirmary in Pickering, Ont. Gollner, in The Book of Immortality, captured some of his former professor’s last thoughts regarding a life of work: “Our travails give us purpose. Sacrifice leads to the life force; in a mysterious way, they flow one into the other.” Father Gervais died March 25, 2012.

Distinguished Professor Emeritus Henry Habib is an accomplished scholar of international law and Middle Eastern politics. He is a valued commentator in the national media and a highly respected speaker on international affairs. He is also the founder of Concordia’s Department of Political Science.
Now semi-retired, Habib is credited with providing a permanent home for the discipline at Loyola College in 1961. He served as chair of the department for 24 years — first at Loyola College (1961-1969) and then at Concordia (1982-1998).
Habib sat on the Board of Governors for more than two decades until 1997, when he received the title of Governor Emeritus. “I’m proud to belong to Concordia. We have become the mosaic of the Canada of the future,” he said in 2006 while celebrating .
Habib has taught thousands of students since the early days of the Department of Political Science. A dedicated and consistent professor, he instilled in his students a thirst for knowledge and the spirit of inquiry.
Habib discussed his approach to teaching in the Thursday Report in 1985: “If you are truly interested in what you’re telling your students, then you will come across as vital yourself.” That year, Concordia presented him with a John W. O’Brien Distinguished Teaching Award.
Former students George Lengvari, BA 63, and Daniel Colson, BA 68, took initiatives to thank Habib. They established the Dr. Henry P. Habib In-Course Bursary and the Henry P. Habib Undergraduate Bursary in Political Science to ensure his legacy

The art of enabling research-creation
Digital games constitute an exciting, emerging form of cultural production, according to Lynn Hughes in an interview published in . She believes that, for example, they are relevant in an increasingly systematized world and alert us to the constructed, systemic nature of our realities, allowing us to be more critical.
Hughes is Concordia University Research Chair in Interaction Design and Games Innovation. Her interest in the digital medium derives from her work as an artist, researcher and teacher.
With an educational background in art, literature and the history and philosophy of mathematics, Hughes does not hesitate to colour outside the lines.
She joined Concordia’s Department of Studio Arts in 1989 as assistant professor of painting and drawing. She subsequently held a number of positions at the Faculty of Fine Arts, including that of Associate Dean, Research and International Relations.
She distinguished herself in that role, earning a 2012 Concordia University Academic Leadership Award. Dominic Peltier-Rivest, director of the Centre for Academic Leadership praised her for “guiding the faculty toward increased research capacity and a fuller articulation of fine arts to the research mission of Concordia.”
Hughes has been an energetic advocate of research-creation through her own interactive digital works as well as through the groups and centers she helped establish.
She was co-founder and co-director of Interstices, an inter-university research-creation group, which between 2000 and 2010, was one of the first research groups funded to promote research-creation. Interstices brought together graduate students from Concordia and UQAM to collaborate on interactive art productions.
She played an instrumental role in the funding and structuring of the Hexagram Institute for Research-Creation in Media Arts and Technologies. With about 100 researchers, Hexagram remains the largest and most productive hub in Canada for research-creation in emerging models of interdisciplinary art and performance.
More recently, Hughes co-founded Concordia’s
a cross-disciplinary, interfaculty group of researchers and artists, which embodies her vision of uniting individuals and groups from Concordia and beyond.
Hughes’s own works have been exhibited across Canada and internationally, including in the US, Europe Asia and South America. She recently co-curated a major exhibition of contemporary games as culture at La Gaîté lyrique in Paris and is currently organizing exhibitions about ludic culture in Mexico City and Spain.

Hughes is the 20th recipient of the prestigious accolade, conceived at Loyola College in 1961 to pay tribute to outstanding Canadians.
Concordia university recognized Hughes for her public service and nationwide drive to end the stigma associated with mental illness.
She is the National Spokesperson for Bell Canada’s Mental Health initiative and the ‘Let’s Talk’ campaign. By sharing her own past struggles with depression, Clara has helped break down the stigma associated with mental illness.

Dealership king and Concordia benefactor
It wouldn’t be outrageous to call Norman D. Hébert car king of Quebec, yet there’s more to the nonagenarian than a new set of wheels. Inspired by Henry Ford’s 20th-century goal — that any man with a good job should be able to afford an automobile — Hébert, LLD 05, began selling automotive components in 1950.
In 1959, Hébert purchased Park Avenue Chevrolet, a car dealership on the verge of bankruptcy. Every inch the entrepreneur, Hébert relocated operations to a barren lot in Montreal North in the hope that sales would thrive. They did.
More than a half-century and 600 employees later, Hébert’s tenacity — cultivated when he was a hotshot student politician at Loyola College — transformed the modest operation into a franchise titan. The outfit has earned diverse accolades, including Time magazine’s first-ever Dealer of the Year award in 1972.
Adding to a Midas touch for sales, Hébert was a pioneer too. His burgeoning dealer network was the first in Canada to computerize its accounts and introduce leasing. In 1969, as its founding chairman, Hébert launched the Montreal International Auto Show.
Hébert’s son, Norman Hébert Jr., BComm 77, joined the family business in 1981. Father and son innovated, introducing “auto malls” — tightly clustered, multi-brand dealerships — which quickly caught on with busy car buyers.
Today, Groupe Park Avenue controls 18 dealerships in Quebec. Including recent acquisitions in British Columbia, the company has the largest multi-brand inventory in Canada.
Business triumphs helped propel philanthropic initiatives, and Hébert has generously honoured his alma mater. Inspired by his wife Johanne, who studied at Sir George Williams Business College, and his son’s Loyola College education, Hébert volunteered as a canvasser on Concordia’s 1983-1988 Capital Campaign. From 1998 to 2003, Hébert served as a key member of Concordia’s Annual Campaign committee.
Today, Hébert and his family have given more than $1 million to endow scholarships in engineering and business at Concordia. The Norman D. Hébert Scholarships, awarded annually based on academic merit, mark the family’s enduring commitment to society-building.
The Hébert legacy will not only be remembered — it lives on. In 2005, Concordia presented Hébert with an honourary degree for his support. The Norman D. Hébert Meeting Room in the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex reflects the family’s tremendous magnanimity. Following his father’s example, Hébert Jr. has been an active alumnus and was named chair of Concordia’s Board of Governors in 2012.
An active member of Montreal’s business elite, Hébert has held key roles in charitable and industrial organizations. He is past president of the Fondation Hôpital Notre-Dame, the Quebec Arthritis Society and Centraide’s Special Names Committee. Hébert is also former director of the Industrial Alliance Insurance Company and past president of the Montreal Automobile Dealers Association.

Official chaplain of the homeless
Father Emmett Johns, BA 74, LLD 97, had been a parish priest for nearly 40 years when he decided to dedicate himself to fighting youth poverty. In 1988, the Montreal native founded Dans la rue.
He took out a $10,000 loan and purchased a used motorhome, which he drove around the city at night to offer a safe place, a meal and a listening ear to homeless youths. Within a year, Bishop Leonard J. Crowley named Father Johns “official chaplain of the homeless.”
The young people who congregated around the motorhome at night affectionately called him “Pops.” The charitable organization has grown considerably and, thanks to dedicated volunteers and donors, it now provides a variety of services through its overnight shelter (the Bunker) and its day centre (Chez Pops).
Members of the Concordia community have been long-time supporters of Dans la rue. Students have organized many fundraisers over the years while the Department of Design and Computation Arts pioneered an outreach program with the organization to empower street kids and combat exclusion.
Parallel to these initiatives, Concordia’s Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling participated in the 20th anniversary of Dans la rue by helping collect, organize and present testimonies that retold the early days of Father Johns’s nighttime rounds.
In 1997, the Loyola alumnus received an
from Concordia University. Pamela Bright, then associate professor in the Department of Theological Studies, introduced him as a “beacon of light for more than 150,000 homeless and runaway youths on the streets of Montreal.”
He was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal (2002) and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012). Father Johns was admitted into the Order of Canada in 1999 and made Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec four years later.
Father Johns has received numerous other awards for his tireless efforts, including the Rights and Freedoms Prize awarded by the Commission des Droits de la personne et des droits à la jeunesse (2001), the Anne Greenup Citizenship Award (1998), the United Irish Societies of Montreal’s Simon McDonaugh Humanitarian Award (2002) and the Martin Luther King Jr. Legacy Award (2008).

BA 94 Great Concordian
Internationally renowned comedy writer
Barry Julien, BA 94, loves monkeying around — so much so that he set out to make it his life’s work. The writer, comic, actor and native Montrealer got his start performing stand-up at age 17 and it’s safe to say his dreams came true.
Julien is now co-executive producer and writer at The Colbert Report, a Comedy Central spinoff of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and one of the most watched late-night television programs.
Julien began to write professionally for Canadian television in the ‘90s. His first big break at CBC’s beloved political satire show This Hour Has 22 Minutes garnered him two Gemini Award nominations. He stocked another for his work on the YTV children’s series Mystery Hunters.
He wrote regularly for satirical newspaper The Onion and, in 2006, took over as staff writer for Talkshow with Spike Feresten, Fox’s longest-running, late-night television series.
Julien joined America’s favourite mock right-wing pundit, Stephen Colbert, in 2007. One of 10 staff writers at The Colbert Report, Julien was promoted to co-executive producer in 2012. While he was head writer in 2009, the team gave an in-depth, group interview at the Paley Center for Media.
Enjoying remarkable critical acclaim, Julien received several Writer’s Guild Awards and three Primetime Emmy Awards (2008, 2010 and 2013) for his writing. The show itself has taken numerous other awards.
Julien has even gone to war for his job. Four episodes of The Colbert Report were filmed in Baghdad for United Service Organization troops in 2009. Julien warmed up the crowd for Colbert and they each shaved their head to fit in.
Julien has stacked up several Hollywood acting credits. He appears in The Hunger with David Bowie, The Art of War with Wesley Snipes and The Last Kiss with Zach Braff, among others.
A proud Concordia alumnus, Julien returned to Concordia to present a workshop to Communication Studies students during the 2009 Distinguished Alumni Series.
With The Colbert Report in its last season, the world is waiting to see how Julien will get the next laugh.

“Jutra-hommage” for a stellar career in cinema
A powerful presence in Quebec cinema for decades, Micheline Lanctôt was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Jutra Award in 2014.
The Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema part-time instructor launched her acting career at Cannes in 1972 after a chance encounter with celebrated director and screenwriter Gilles Carle. At the time, she worked in film animation at the director Gerald Potterton’s studios.
“I didn’t know her, I had never spoken to her. But I saw in her an elegance, and gradually, I began to visualize her in a landscape,” remembered Carle, director of La vraie nature de Bernadette (1972) in an interview for .
Lanctôt then went on to star in Les corps célestes (1973), The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974), Les liens de sang (1978), and Mourir à tue-tête (1978) to name but a few of the works that compose her filmography.
Her directorial debut, L’homme à tout faire (1980), was recognized with a Silver Medal for Best Picture at the San Sebastián Film Festival. Sonatine (1982), her second feature film, won a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and a Genie Award for Best Achievement in Direction.
After receiving a phone call from Concordia University Professor Thomas Waugh, Lanctôt ventured into teaching in 1982. “It was the beginning of a big love story for me, which is still ongoing. When I fall out of love then I’ll stop giving my classes,” she confided in a .
Lanctôt returned to directing feature-length films with the encouragement of her students. Deux actrices (1993) featured two Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema alumnae – Pascale Paroissien and Pascale Bussières — and among its film crew were several students. Of all the films she has directed, Lanctôt is most proud of this one. It won Grand Prize at the 1994 Rendez-vous du cinéma Québécois.
More recently, Lanctôt has made appearances in award-winning productions directed by Concordia University graduates, most notably Louise Archambault’s Familia (2005) and Chloé Robichaud’s Sarah préfère la course (2013).
Her 10th film, , premieres February 27, 2015, within the 33rd Rendez-vous du cinéma québécois.
Among Lanctôt’s numerous awards are the Governor General’s Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award (2003) and the Prix Albert-Tessier du Québec (2000).

A theological giant
The Globe and Mail called Father Bernard Lonergan, LLD 77, a “theological giant” in March 1970. Time magazine corroborated a few weeks later noting the Jesuit scholar was “considered by many intellectuals to be the finest philosophic thinker of the 20th century.”
Born in Buckingham, Quebec, in 1918, he relocated to Montreal to study at Loyola College, one of Concordia’s founding institutions. He was a gifted student, but ill health forced him to interrupt his studies in the early months of 1920. He returned later that year and carried on until 1922 when, in his sophomore year, he decided to join the Society of Jesus.
He taught Latin and Greek at Loyola College in the early 1930s as part of his regency assignment. Father Lonergan then studied in Rome and Amiens, France, before moving to Toronto, where he began work on Insight: A Study of Human Understanding and Method in Theology. Newsweek compared this seminal work to David Hume’s An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. He was the author of numerous books.
When Loyola College marked its 75th anniversary in 1971, Father Lonergan returned to his alma mater. Then-president of the Loyola Alumni Association Brian Gallery, BA 57, LLD 10, presented the Jesuit scholar with the Loyola Medal in recognition of an incomparable body of works which gave “needed point to human values in the present crisis of human existence, and clear direction to human aspirations in the generations to come.”
Concordia awarded Father Lonergan an . Lonergan College was founded to encourage discussions and research dealing with aspects of the philosopher-theologian’s ideas. Similar centres now exist around the globe.
Father Lonergan was named a Peritus at the Second Vatican Council. He was made a Companion of the Order of Canada (1971) and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (1975). He died in 1984.

Youth Fusion founder keeps students in school
Gabriel Bran Lopez, BA 08, has travelled quite a distance since leaving civil war-torn Guatemala with his family in the early 1980s. As an immigrant child living in an impoverished neighborhood, he faced innumerable challenges as he sought to find his voice and his place in a new environment.
A supportive teacher led him to accept the leading role in a student play about a boy who suffers from leukemia. The experience proved life-changing and propelled Lopez to take an active role in student life at his school. He launched leadership programs, organized sporting events and helped create the first student council. He had found his calling.
While a student in Concordia’s Department of Communication Studies, he served as treasurer of the Communications Studies Student Association and as president of the Garnet Key Society. He travelled to Uganda with the Concordia Volunteer Abroad Program.
Lopez is now president of Youth Fusion, a charity he established in 2008 to reverse dropout rates across Quebec. The organization began as a pilot project at Concordia.
“The idea was simple yet had never been implemented in Canada: hire university students and recent graduates and send them into poorly performing schools to implement projects that motivate teenagers to stay in school, strengthen their school spirit and give them a sense of belonging,” Lopez explained to The Philanthropist.
From seven Concordia-based project coordinators working in two Montreal schools, Youth Fusion has grown to employ dozens of coordinators from several universities to help students as far north as Nunavik stay in school.
Lopez is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Michel-Perron Award (2013), Ernst & Young’s Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award (2011), Public Policy Forum Emerging Leader Award (2010), Sauvé Scholarship (2009-2010), Forces Avenir Personality Award (2007), Concordia’s John E. O’Brien Medal (2007) and the Concordia University Alumni Association’s Outstanding Student Award (2007).
Loyola Medal
Cardinal Léger was bestowed the Loyola Medal in 1967. Here is the citation read at the ceremony.
“Outstanding leadership and achievement on the Canadian scene, by reason of the character, philosophy, and contribution to the heritage of ·Canada of the recipient. “
To whom, more appropriately, might these terms, the criteria for the award of the Loyola Medal, apply than to Paul-Emile, Cardinal Leger, Archbishop of Montreal?
Priest, teacher, missionary, pastor of his flock, renowned and loved for his own great love and compassion for the poor, the aged, the sick, the very young, the disabled, the underprivileged, and all of those whose lot in life has been misfortune rather than good fortune, misery rather than joy, disillusionment rather than fulfillment.
Founder of seminaries, rector of the prestigious Canadian College at Rome, Archbishop, Cardinal Prince of the Church, leader of thought and of action in the preparations for, the carrying out, and the aftermath of the Great Council Vatican I; collaborator of His Holiness Paul VI, leading proponent of the ecumenical spirit of this day, recipient of a multitude of honours conferred by Church, by States and by the academic community, outstanding personality in this City, Province, and Canada itself.
In the person of Paul-Emile, Cardinal Leger, no paradox occurs, no contradiction arises in the presence of such diverse qualities. In this age of revolution, cultural, educational, moral, quiet and otherwise, essential truth shines forth from him.
Error is exposed. True progress is encouraged; rather it is initiated and insisted upon by him. Both clergy and laity, at all levels, are led by him to take their rightful place and to do their full duty - in the church, in the community, in the nation, and in the world.
From him, we know that the miseries of the African tribesman, of the Asian rice farmer, of the poor of our own community and of those unfortunates trapped in a life of crime or of vice, must be of more immediate and vital interest to us than our affluent society, the expansion of industry and commerce, the profusion of great new buildings and works, and advances in science and learning. For he has seen with his own eyes all of these, and setting such things in their due perspective he tells us that these latter phenomena are of benefit and validity only  insofar as they may alleviate and redress the inequalities and injustices posed by the former.
By the brilliance of his career and its accomplishments; by the embodiment in him of that greatest of virtues, charity; by his message, which he not only preaches but lives to the full all of' his days; by his humility; by his wisdom; by his devotion and great service - we of Loyola, and all of the community, are continually edified.
Your Eminence; we are here tonight to honour you because of all of these things - but you, by your presence and your acceptance of what we have to offer, do us a much greater honour. Four thousand former students of Loyola, who form the Loyola Alumni Association, join their alma mater in bestowing upon you, as its second recipient, the highest honour in their gift – the Loyola Medal.

“Girls Invade Campus for Co-Instruction,” read a headline in the September 25, 1959, issue of Loyola News.
Loretta Mahoney, BSc 62, MBA 74, was looking for a “well-rounded education with Catholic philosophy” when she enrolled at Loyola College in 1959.
Joined by fellow engineering student Gabrielle Paul, BSc 62, the two women pioneered co-education at the Jesuit institution, becoming the first female students to register for courses in the daytime program.
“Girls Invade Campus for Co-Instruction,” read a headline in the September 25, 1959, issue of Loyola News. Despite keeping a low profile in her first year, Mahoney quickly made a place for herself, contributing to college life and rising to the top of her class.
In 1962, Paul and Mahoney became Loyola College’s first female graduates. Mahoney also became its first woman valedictorian.
Mahoney’s dedication to overcoming prejudice against women in the field of natural sciences earned her a place among Concordia’s “.”
She remained committed to that cause as she rose through the ranks of the male-dominated energy sector, from analyst at the now-defunct Petrofina to director of Energy, Mines, and Resources with the Government of Canada.
Mahoney died in 2004. Yet her legacy lives on through the Loretta Mahoney Memorial Bursary, which she founded at her alma mater to encourage young female students to pursue undergraduate studies in engineering and computer science.

Sir George Williams' very own beer connoisseur
Peter McAuslan, BA 72, forever changed the Quebec beer landscape by founding the brewery that bears his name. A graduate of Sir George Williams University, one of Concordia’s founding institutions, he first worked as a community organizer for the YMCA before occupying a number of administrative positions at Dawson College.
He had been brewing his own beer for more than two decades when he decided, in the late 1980s, to dedicate himself to a passion that had been with him since his undergraduate years.
In 1988, McAuslan and his wife, Ellen Bounsall, founded McAuslan Brewing, known for its award-winning St-Ambroise and Griffon brands. As president and CEO of the company, he supported various non-profit organizations, including the St. Andrew’s Society of Montreal and the Empress cultural centre. The Montreal Film Festival, the Montreal Fringe theatre festival and the Montreal Celtic Festival have also benefited from the support of McAuslan Brewing.
Last year, the couple announced they had sold the company to Les Brasseurs RJ and semi-retired in the Eastern Townships.
“I have started a small hop yard, have a maple bush, a large vegetable garden to keep me busy as well as community and business interests. I will have time to enjoy the pleasures of home brewing again,” McAuslan .
The beer connoisseur has remained an active member of the Concordia University community.
He served as co-chair for both Homecoming 97 and the Alumni and Friends Division of the university’s Campaign for a New Millennium. He was also president of the Concordia University Alumni Association (CUAA) from 2000 to 2002.
Naturally, he organized several Brewer’s Dinners and Beer Tasting events, which helped raised funds for scholarships offered by the CUAA. In 2009, he earned the Alumni of the Year award. He is also the recipient of an Award of Distinction from the John Molson School of Business.

From Rhodes Scholar to peacebuilding advocate
Carol McQueen, BA 95, began her post-Concordia life with an auspicious start: she was awarded a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship and headed off to the University of Oxford.
The Liberal Arts College graduate remained in the United Kingdom and earned her PhD from Oxford. Her dissertation dealt with safety zones in 1990s Bosnia, Iraq and Rwanda.
Her commitment to peacebuilding took off from there. In 2003, McQueen relocated to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where she served as political affairs officer with the UN Peacekeeping Mission.
“As the plane descended toward Kinshasa […], I realized I was fulfilling a longstanding dream to work for the United Nations, in the hope of helping bring peace, even in a small way, to a country that had endured almost five years of intense conflict between rebels and government forces,” she told
at the time.
In the ensuing years McQueen held a number of posts at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Development Canada, including deputy director of the now-defunct Democracy Unit and policy analyst with the Peacebuilding and Conflict Prevention Group.
Building on her experience and doctoral research, she wrote Humanitarian Intervention and Safety Zones: Iraq, Bosnia and Rwanda (Palgrave Macmillan, 2005). Shortly after the book’s publication McQueen returned to her alma mater to deliver a talk, sponsored by the Liberal Arts College and the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies, on peacekeeping and the advances made in the prevention of mass violence.
McQueen later returned to Central and East Africa and worked as a political counsellor at the Canadian High Commission in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Following that, she returned to Canada and was director for Gulf States Relations at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada. Her portfolio included responsibility for the Iran and Iraq files.
In August 2015 .
She is married and has two children.

BA 72 Great Concordian,
Outstanding Staff Award – 2014
International authority on economic policy
Marguerite Mendell, BA 72, has spent her career avidly exploring ways to make communities better through sound economic policy.
In recognition of the profound influence Mendell has had on the social economy over the past three decades, in 2013 she was awarded the Prix du Québec — the highest accolade offered by the Government of Quebec.
On the honour, Mendell said: “My research has been based on the dynamic nature of Quebec society — a place I love. To be recognized by the government at this stage in my career is very rewarding, but also overwhelming.”
In 2014, she was named an officer of the Ordre national du Québec.
Mendell earned a PhD in economics from McGill University in 1983. She is co-founder of Concordia’s Karl Polanyi Institute of Political Economy, where she has served as director since 1987. She also teaches at the School of Community and Public Affairs in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, educating the next generation of public and economic policy analysts.
Her steadfast contribution to higher education at Concordia was honoured with the Concordia University Alumni Association’s Outstanding Faculty/Staff Award in 2014.
The Parisian-born economist’s savvy is highly sought after outside the academic community — the Great Concordian has been consulted by three levels of government in Canada and by the European Union, mainly on issues related to social and community finance.
Mendell’s publications have been translated into French, Spanish, Italian and Korean — and have generated great international interest. Among those works are “The Three Pillars of the Social Economy: The Quebec Experience (1996-2007)” and “Karl Polanyi and Instituted Process of Economic Democratization.”
She was keynote speaker at the Social Economy Global Forum, co-hosted by the mayor of Seoul, South Korea, in 2013. She also served as director of the Scientific Committee for the International Forum on the Social and Solidarity Economy in Montreal.

Enfant terrible of Canadian abstract painting
Guido Molinari, LLD 04, a towering figure of the Canadian abstract art scene, began painting in his early teens. Often described as a self-taught artist, he did attend courses at Montreal’s École des Beaux-arts before eschewing formal training to work under the guidance of Marian Dale Scott at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.
A 1951 encounter with members of the Automatiste movement helped Molinari situate himself within a post-Refus global Quebec. By the end of the decade, he had held his first solo show, exhibited his work in New York, founded the Galerie L’Actuelle and helped create the Non-Figurative Artists Association.
Molinari then went on to win the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts’ Jessie Dow Award (1962), the Royal Canadian Academy of the Arts Award (1965), the Guggenheim Foundation Scholarship (1967), the David E. Bright Foundation Award (1968) and the Prix Paul-Émile Borduas (1980).
An artist of international renown, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971. By then, he had already begun teaching at Sir George Williams University, one of Concordia’s founding institutions. Molinari had acquired 27 years of service as a part-time instructor by the time he retired in 1997.
His work at Concordia University “allowed him to work free from the dictates and voracious appetite of the art market,” he said in a 1995 interview for The Gazette, following the launch of a major retrospective at the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal.
Molinari’s work has been exhibited and collected nationally and internationally and can be found in the National Gallery of Canada and New York’s Museum of Modern Art.
Molinari died in 2004. The achievements of this enfant terrible of Canadian abstract painting were recognized that year with a posthumous .
“This remarkably giving man, this vibrant and entertaining teacher, was one of the original members of the small group of artists who were the foundation of our Faculty of Fine Arts,” said Concordia Professor Christopher Jackson.

Vision, leadership, benevolence and commitment
L. Jacques Ménard, BComm 67, LLD 06, is chairman of BMO Nesbitt Burns and President of BMO Financial Group, Quebec.
He is a director at Claridge Inc., Léger Marketing, Stingray Digital and WestJet — as well as in the sport and non-profit sectors, including the Montreal Alouettes, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Trudeau Foundation and Institute for Research on Public Policy. A past chairman of Hydro-Québec, he is well-known in Montreal for his efforts to keep the Expos at home in the 1990s.

Aptly described as a “superachiever” by Michel Magnan, Concordia’s Jarislowsky Chair in Corporate Governance, he continuously demonstrates “total commitment to the society in which he lives.”
Ménard is a long-time supporter of Concordia University. Despite a schedule that would leave most people exhausted, he makes time for causes close to his heart. He joined Concordia’s Board of Governors in 1994 and played an especially important role in the Campaign for a New Millennium. He received Concordia’s prestigious Loyola Medal in 1999 and an honorary doctorate in 2006.
When appointed chancellor of Concordia University in 2010, Ménard said, “I’m proud to continue my longstanding collaboration with a university that has greatly contributed to my career and my social concerns.” He completed his term in December 2014.
The 2010s have thus far been a period of celebration, with Ménard becoming an officer of the Ordre national du Québec (2010), receiving the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012) and ascending to the highest level of the Order of Canada (2012).
In addition to his Concordia degrees, he holds an MBA from the University of Western Ontario. He will receive an honorary doctorate from McGill University at its spring 2015 convocation.

O’Brien is an accomplished teacher, author, speaker and administrator. After graduation from Loyola College in 1945, he joined the Society of Jesus, where he was ordained in 1957, and earned a doctorate in Communication from the University of Southern California (USC) in 1964. He returned to his alma mater, where he founded Canada’s first department of Communication Studies in 1965, then known as Communication Arts at Loyola College.
O’Brien’s pioneering vision and passion for the study and application of media, combined with his training as a Jesuit priest, led him down an unusual career path for a clergyman who had taken a vow of poverty.
While a student at USC, O’Brien was elected president of Alpha Epsilon Rho, known today as the National Broadcasting Society, an American association for broadcast and media students. For Montreal’s Expo 67 world fair, he chaired the Christian Pavilion programming committee.

No excuses, no limits
Montreal’s Luca “Lazylegz” Patuelli, BComm 09, was one of the shining stars of the 2010 Vancouver Paralympics Opening Ceremonies. In 2013, he performed on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, receiving a standing ovation after wowing the audience.
His brilliant performances are the culmination of a decade-long exploration of the art of breakdancing.
Patuelli was born with a rare condition known as arthrogryposis, a disorder characterized by joint contractures and a lack of muscle development. It affected his lower body, but didn’t prevent him from taking on skateboarding.
When knee surgery forced Patuelli to abandon the sport in his mid-teens, he turned to breakdancing — using his strong upper body and crutches to assert himself on dance floors across the city, the country and the world.
He joined the Illmatic Styles in 2004 and accompanied the dance group to the United States where they performed on . Patuelli then travelled incessantly as he refined and expanded his inventory of dance moves. In 2007, he founded , a crew of differently-abled dancers from the Netherlands, Chili and the United States. His motto? No excuses, no limits.
Patuelli’s unflinching drive also helped him complete an undergraduate degree at Concordia’s John Molson School of Business. The 2000s was a busy decade for him, but he succeeded thanks to support from administrators and professors during the seven years he spent at Concordia.
“It’s doable. School’s been extremely accommodating,” he explained in an interview for Concordia student newspaper The Link.
Patuelli has not slowed down since graduating six years ago. Aside from the Vancouver performance, he appeared at the 2011 Parapan American Games and, more recently, he danced on the set of the .
In 2015, he received the Governor General’s Meritorious Service Medal.
He is co-founder of Project RAD, a Montreal-based organization that offers dance programs for kids with disabilities.

History, fiction, and award-winning stories
Pulitzer-prize-winning author Annie Proulx, MA 73, LLD 99, was enrolled in the doctoral program in history when Sir George Williams University and Loyola College merged to become Concordia.
Proulx had just completed a master’s thesis exploring the writings of Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini. Her interest in Renaissance economic history was matched by a similar fascination for the works of scholars attached to the Annales School.
Proulx was on the path to academia when she decided — shortly after successfully completing her oral examinations — to abandon her studies and move back to New England with her sons.
Proulx worked as a freelance journalist to support her family, but she also experimented with fiction in ways that reflected her continued interest in history.
“I was attracted to the French Annales School, which pioneered minute examination of the lives of ordinary people through account books, wills, marriage and death records, farming and crafts techniques and the development of technologies,” she told the Missouri Review in 1999. “There is this certain dispassionate, observational part of me that follows what’s happening in rural places,” she further explained in the Wyoming Library Roundup.
Proulx’s first collection of short stories was published under the title Heart Songs in 1988. Postcards (1992), her debut novel, received a PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. Proulx was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts grant and a Guggenheim fellowship in the early 1990s, which allowed her to complete The Shipping News (1993), a multi-award-winning novel adapted for the screen in 2001.
The Pulitzer Prize recipient has since published several novels and short stories including the widely-acclaimed “Brokeback Mountain,” which first appeared in The New Yorker in 1997. The story was subsequently adapted for the big screen. It won three Oscars at the 78th Academy Awards (Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Score).
Proulx returned to Concordia in 1999 to receive an honorary doctorate.

Loyola Medal
Citation read at Dr. Selye's award ceremony:
This evening we present the Loyola Medal to a man who has profoundly changed attitudes throughout the medical world.
Dr. Selye’s work in experimental medicine at l’Universite de Montréal has opened up research in a field which has been long overlooked. I speak now, of course, of stress -- a phenomenon which touches all our lives. Not only has Dr. Selye discovered the importance of stress, he has taken measures through his writings to help us to cope with it. His widely-acclaimed book, Stress Without Distress, has assisted thousands of people to deal with stressful situations.
The essentials of Dr. Selye’s career cover six typewritten pages of his curriculum vitae. Even this is only a sparse list itemizing scholarly achievements, positions held, awards, honors, fellowships and dates spanning nearly fifty years. But from this data, we can draw a sound, if imperfect sketch of greatness.
Dr. Selye was born in Vienna in 1907, the son of a prominent doctor, in an age when the Austrian Empire had lost little of its imperial splendor. During the intellectually effervescent ’20s, the young Selye, at the age of 22, received his MD at the German University in Prague. By the time he was 35, he had received degrees and held teaching posts at the Université de Paris, the University of Rome, Johns Hopkins and McGill.
He then went to be an expert consultant to the office of the Surgeon-General of the U.S. Army. In the ’50s, he held a wide variety of posts in Latin America. During this period Dr. Selye was also director of the Université de Montréal’s Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, the directorship he holds today.
One could go one from here. There was the Rockefeller Research Fellowship, a consultancy in Calcutta, memberships in a score of world professional associations: The Associations of Cancer Research, the Aerospace Medical Association and Hungary's Centre for Coagulation of Blood, Capillar and Practical Research on Muscles -- to name just a few. We all know of his books and perhaps it's worth noting that at last count he had completed more than 1,200 articles relating to his field of study.
In short it would be a far simpler task to itemize what Dr. Selye has not done in his field, so impressive is his list of accomplishments. But it must be remembered too that Dr. Selye continues to work in his field.
The Loyola Medal, the top honor we can bestow, is awarded to the great, not so much for what they have done, but for what they are doing. Previous recipients include Paul-Émile Cardinal Leger and Therese Casgrain. They are examples of past accomplishment to be sure, but also of future potential. Dr. Selye is one of these. His work remains a vista, not a closed book.
The research findings of his institute hold great promise for mankind
Not long ago, Dr. Selye came to speak at the University. His words gave us a glimpse into his philosophy. He was speaking about mankind's over-reliance on the conventional view, and the dangers thereof. Dr. Selye said, “…the idea that the sun rises every morning and sets every evening is obvious -- but it is not true. It took enormous genius on the part of Galileo.”
Dr. Selye reveals his modus vivendi, I think: a readiness to buck the tide, to stand against the full force of conventional wisdom, a constant willingness to search for the new when lesser individuals seek refuge in the old. It is for this reason Dr., Selye stands in the halls of greatness.
The Loyola Medal is given to an outstanding Canadian, but Dr. Selye honors Canada by choosing this country as his own. We now hope he will honor us by receiving the Loyola Medal for 1976.

"The most important Canadian in history"
Born in 1888, the Right Honourable Georges P. Vanier, BA 06, lived through Canada’s most trying times. A graduate of Loyola College, one of Concordia’s founding institutions, he fought valiantly with the 22nd Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the Great War, losing his right leg during the conflict.
He returned home with a Military Cross and a Distinguished Service Order — among other medals and decorations — for his bravery and contributions to the war effort.
Vanier helped pioneer Canada’s diplomatic service during the interwar years by serving with the military delegation at the League of Nations, acting as secretary to the High Commission of Canada in London, and leading the country’s legation in France.
The outbreak of the Second World War forced him to leave mainland Europe although he maintained contact with Charles de Gaulle’s Free France and other governments in exile. He returned to Paris in 1944 as Canadian ambassador until his retirement nine years later. He was brought back into active public life in 1959 when he became Governor General of Canada, an office he held until his death in 1967.
In 1998, Maclean’s named Vanier the most important Canadian in history. “Vanier was Canada’s moral compass as governor general, an unquestioned man of probity and honor,” explained J. L. Granatstein to the readers of the Canadian weekly.
It was with great pride that Loyola College welcomed back Canada’s top citizen in the early 1960s. Vanier had graduated as valedictorian in 1906, winning the Gold Medal for General Proficiency in Philosophy. He was invited back to his alma mater in 1963 to receive another medal. This one bore the inscription “Insignus Ductu et Rebus Gestis” (For Outstanding Leadership and Achievement).
In 1963, Vanier became the first recipient of the , conceived to honour exceptional individuals “whose character, genius and philosophies have illustrated the ideals of the Catholic Church, contributed to the arts and sciences of Canada, and enriched the heritage of humanity at large.” Without a doubt, Governor General Vanier was a worthy recipient for the inauguration of this award.
