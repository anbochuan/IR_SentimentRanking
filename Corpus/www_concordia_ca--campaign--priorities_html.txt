CAMPAIGN PRIORITIESHelp create a place where ideas, talent and impact intersect.
Join us to create a future that mobilizes science, humanities, art and business to meet modern challenges. The Campaign for Concordia will support big ideas with breakthrough potential.
Next-generation ideas
To address tomorrow’s biggest challenges, we’re developing new institutes, research centres, think tanks and academic programs. Learn what key areas we’re investing in and how we intend to double Concordia’s research.
Next-generation talent
We’re multiplying hands-on and work-integrated learning. We’re creating accessible online options and building more pathways for international study and social engagement. Learn how we’re preparing tomorrow’s talent.
Next-generation impact
Think tanks, living labs, entrepreneurship centres and innovation hubs are a few of the ways in which we’re increasing our impact-oriented activities. Learn how we’re building on our long history of community and industry engagement.
