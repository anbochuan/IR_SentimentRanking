Why choose the Certificate in Science Foundations?
The Certificate in Science Foundations is a non-degree program that caters to students who wish to develop the necessary background for further study in undergraduate degree programs in Science. It also may be of interest to students whose preference is to follow a shorter program of study or who wish to update their knowledge or learn important basics of science.
Certificate in Science Foundations (30 credits)
The certificate requires successful completion of 30 credits. At least 24 of these credits must be chosen from courses offered by three departments in the Faculty of Arts and Science. Students may transfer into the certificate program up to 12 credits earned in an incomplete degree or certificate program or as an Independent student, provided they are students in good standing. The credits that may be so transferred are determined by the University at the point of entry into the program. Students who are admitted to the Certificate in Science Foundations, and who wish to continue in a degree program, should apply for admission to their program within the first 30 credits.
