Renting guidelines
Textbook rentals allow us to reuse and recycle books. We hope that you return your rental textbook to us in a condition for someone else to reuse later. If the textbook is returned with excessive highlighting or writing, missing pages, and/or damaged spines or covers, you will be charged for the replacement of the book.
Late returns
If you do not return your rental by that return date you will automatically be charged the full retail price of the book to your student account. Rentals are due at the end of each term. Rental due dates are listed on your receipt.
