Concordia Research Administration Database (ConRAD)
The University has launched an automated system for the management of research information. ConRAD allows for the internal review and endorsement of applications of grants and the submission of compliance protocols. Researchers can submit and review documents through their access to ConRAD in the MyConcordia Portal.
Important messages for researchers:
1. If you are trying to access ConRAD off-campus, you must login to .
2. To avoid issues, use the following browsers: Firefox or Chrome. The system does not work well with Safari.
3. The link to ConRAD (Concordia Research Administration Database) is located in the “Research and Innovation” folder inside your MyConcordia portal. All grant applications are now routed through Concordia’s electronic ConRAD system, replacing the paper based Grant Submission Form (GSF).
4. In the “Research and Innovation” folder you will also find My Explore Concordia, our online info. form for submitting and updating your Explore Concordia page. Please take this opportunity to review and update your page! If you still do not have an Explore Concordia page, please join your colleagues by clicking the My Explore Concordia link to create one. About 650 faculty members now are participating, including several entire departments. Have a look:
Apply for Grant Funding

University approval to apply.

using your Netname and Password.
Choose ConRAD under "Research and Innovation".
Under "Apply New" and open the necessary form about one week before the internal deadline.
Complete the fields.
Attach the final version of your proposal.
ConRAD automatically routes your request through the internal approval process, ending at the Office of Research (OOR).
At the OOR, we can approve your application by:
sending it to the sponsor via their online system, or
signing the hardcopy, if the sponsor prefers a paper submission.
When your proposal is ready for submission to the sponsor, follow the sponsor’s instructions:
Sponsors using online systems: submit your final proposal through their system and the OOR will approve and forward it to the sponsor. We will also attach a copy to your ConRAD record.
Paper Submissions: OOR will sign the application and you can forward the hardcopy to the sponsor.
Using ConRAD does not replace the need to submit your final proposal to the sponsor.

ConRAD automatically routes your request through to the Office of Research (OOR).
Important: It may take up to 6 weeks for the committee’s decision. Data collection should not begin until ethics approval has been obtained.
