H-7 CONSTRUCTION: A new Student Success Centre
Posted on September 26, 2017
A consolidated  will take over the space vacated by the previous conference facilities, located on the seventh floor of the Henry F. Hall Building (H). As a result, half of the floor will be closed off for the duration of construction.
Concordia’s Student Success Centre supports students in reaching their full potential – personally, academically and professionally – through the help of trained staff and student employees. The centre is now in its third year of operation.
The new, larger and more versatile Student Success Centre will enable greater support for students and provide a welcoming space for workshops and events.
The centre is expected to open in late 2018.
After nine-months of construction, Concordia’s new  is opening its doors on the ninth floor of the  (MB).
