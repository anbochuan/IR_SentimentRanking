Felice Yuen’s research
focuses on leisure and its impact on the quality of life of individuals and the
communities in which they live. More specifically, she is interested in leisure
as a context for community development and civic engagement for marginalized
populations. Recent research projects include studies exploring the experience
of youth in a gang prevention program using hip hop as medium of data
collection, examining the healing process of Aboriginal women through body
mapping (a form of visual arts), and exploring Aboriginal youth health
leadership through creative play workshops. Her research has been done in collaboration with
community-based organizations such as Minwaashin Lodge (a women’s Aboriginal
support centre), Tyndale St. Georges Community Centre, Community Justice
Initiatives, and the Ontario Lung Association.
During her PhD at the University of Waterloo, she was heavily involved in a
study that examined the reintegration needs of incarcerated women. For more
information on this project, please go to .
Felice has presented at national and
international conferences and was a recipient of a Canada Graduate Scholarship
Award from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.
