Current research projects
In Search of Expo 67
In Search of Expo 67, a major exhibition of 19 works by Québec and Canadian artists at the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, investigates the most innovative, experimental and provocative dimensions of this international world fair as well as its artistic, social and political contexts. Largely founded on archival research, these new works are created in dialogue with the spirit of 1967, challenging some of its underlying presumptions and showcasing its incredible degree of invention. Original large-format and multi-screen films will be programmed by CINEMAexpo67 in the MAC's blackbox. Co-curated by Monika Kin Gagnon and Lesley Johnstone. Opens June 21 and runs through October 8 2017.
