FMST 665 Managing Media
Offered: 2017 /2
Credits: 3 credits
Management - on the surface it seems marginal to the films and television we care about; boring, even. Yet there is nothing more critically essential to understanding the process of how an idea for a film makes it to the big screen. This course will examine the mysterious middle realm of media management, from the production processes where film and television and novels get made, to the management of media franchises, star images and brands, to the managing of consumers through increasingly complex and arcane end-user license agreements (EULAs), apps, interfaces and retail environments. It will chart the multiple layers and levels at which media is managed, from platforms to hardware to ad agencies and talent agencies, and will analyze the many self-refential films and TV series that stage these management practices for our enjoyment.

FMST 804 Walter Benjamin and Film Studies
Offered: 2017 /2
Credits: 3 credits
Walter Benjamin was a prolific writer, whose corpus spans a wide range of genres, from philosophy, to criticism, to autobiography. A small cottage industry has developed around Benjamin’s extensive writing, producing an ongoing stream of interpretations, applications, and contextualizations. A host of different “Benjamins” have arisen, depending on the great variety of analytical frameworks and disciplinary concerns. Benjamin’s difficult life in interwar Europe as a nomadic character on the fringes of so many cultural circles is very much part of his philosophy, and cannot be entirely separated from his critical theory. Benjamin worked on the edge of a political precipice, and adapted methodologies from a wide range of cultural currents, expressing himself eloquently in French and German, providing a significant challenge to his English translators. He challenges the film critic and media analyst to craft new avenues of interpretation in order to recognize the utopian within the ideological, and to illuminate the lost promises of technological modernity.
Students in this class are encouraged to think through Benjamin’s critical aesthetics in light of contemporary image culture and tropes of recycling, affect, technologies, and posthumanism. The fragmentation and circulation of images in digital media is anticipated by Benjamin along with its dangers and potentials for social justice. We will explore the ways that his work has been taken up by feminist theorists, media archaeology scholars, and other interdisciplinary scholars as a way of opening up a richly interdisciplinary approach to the aesthetics and politics of film and media. Students will be required to do class presentations and complete a final research paper.
Prerequisites:
Registration in a PhD program in a Humanities discipline.
Some background in critical theory, philosophy, or film theory.
Special instructions:
Please contact the instructor,
- please attach a recent academic transcript and CV.
Please explain why you are interested in the course - priority will be given to students enrolled in the PhD in Film and Moving Image Studies program.

Research Seminar in Relationship Marketing Strategy: Network Approach to Co-Designing the Service Experience
Offered: Winter 2018
Credits: 3
The course provides an overview on what innovation, service experience and design. It entails taking into consideration complex contexts and trends of strategic relationship marketing (SRM). SRM is an evolving bundle of theories, perspectives and concepts outside of traditional marketing and management paradigms. It reaches out towards multidisciplinary approach in research design and outcomes. Thus, the focus of the readings/critical analysis includes service logic, ethics and value creation/destruction, how SRM is moving towards ecosystems and complex offerings where experiences and designs become strategic for the well-being of society, individuals and organizations. The “market” perspective incorporates multiple forms of governance and actors-to-actors requiring a new vision on the architecture and DNA of the organization, digital and human interactions, balancing private and public goods, entrepreneurial spirit, social and prosocial behaviors as part of the overall model rather than “antecedents, process or outcomes”.
Prerequisites: Graduate students who preferably completed one or two required courses in their discipline. Exercise your thought process to think out-of-the box and exercise your creativity.
Special instructions: Graduate students from multidisciplinary perspectives are welcomed (MSc and PhD). The value of the course is around conversation bringing to the table different perspectives. The course does not focus on Consumer Behaviour or traditional marketing concepts. The course outline is subject to change and evolve according to new trends.

MATH 630 Topics in the Psychology of Mathematics Education: Research into students' difficulties in mathematics
Offered: 2017 /2
Credits: 3
This course is premised on the assumption that there is no learning without overcoming some difficulty. If you have experienced no difficulty in performing a task then you have probably learned nothing by doing it. Therefore difficulties are treated as something normal, expected and even welcome. The teacher must have a sufficiently deep understanding of the possible cognitive, epistemological, and didactic sources of difficulties in mathematics to recognize those difficulties in particular students. Based on this understanding, the teacher can create learning situations that motivate students to overcome the difficulties associated with the material. In this course, you will have an opportunity to learn to anticipate the possible difficulties students may have in learning different content areas in mathematics such as arithmetic, high school algebra, geometry, college algebra, college level calculus, and, depending on the interests of the participants, the more advanced areas of mathematics. Difficulties related to the specificity of mathematical reasoning and proving will also be tackled. Students will choose topics to study more in depth according to their own interests. They will inform the instructor about their interests and the instructor will help them select relevant literature.
Prerequisites: Mathematics background with at least college level Algebra and Calculus.

PSYC 727 Circadian Rhythms in Regulation of Brain Processes and Role in Psychiatric Disorders
Offered: 2018 /1
Credits: 3
Recent studies have revealed that clock genes are rhythmically expressed throughout the brain and play critical roles in the regulation of normal brain processes.
Current evidence suggests that circadian rhythms regulate short and long-term synaptic plasticity in neural circuits that underlie rhythmic behaviors, including respiration, blood pressure, cortisol, and locomotor activity, among others. Despite the evidence that circadian rhythms are involved in the regulation of several neural processes and in turn behaviors, this topic has not been extensively studied thus far, and there is much that is not known as to how and why circadian rhythms regulate such processes. Although mammalian circadian rhythms are controlled predominantly by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, recent advances made in this field on the emerging roles of clock gene rhythms across brain regions have suggested that the circadian system is involved in brain region specific regulation of cell activity and specific behaviors. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested a critical role of the circadian system in several disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, stress regulation, age related cognitive deficits including Alzheimer’s disease, eating disorders, drug addiction, and alcoholism. The impact of circadian rhythm disruption on cognitive function, mood, and cardiovascular health, in populations of shift. workers and frequent travelers, may also be due to underlying effects of circadian disruption on synaptic plasticity.
The aim of the seminar is to discuss recent advances in the role of the circadian system in normal brain functions and psychiatric disorders.
Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:
Recent advances in our understanding of peripheral brain oscillators
Clock gene regulation of neuronal function including synaptic plasticity
Circadian rhythm abnormalities in mood disorders and psychotic disorders
Circadian disruption and health in shift workers and frequent travelers
Role of circadian rhythms in cognition and aging
Circadian rhythms in regulation of reward processes and addiction
Interactions between the circadian system and stress response system
Prerequisites: Some background in behavioral neuroscience and/or biology

RELI 630/RELI 833 Anthropology of Christianity
Offered: 2017-18 /4
Credits: 3
Anthropology of Christianity has attracted so much ethnographic and theoretical attention that it  has  become  one  of  the  fastest  growing  sub-disciplines  in  contemporary  anthropology.  This  course will engage current themes that are pertinent to the study of religion in anthropology as a  whole,  but  will  focus  on  major  debates  and  topics  pertaining  especially  to  Christianity.  Themes  may  include  conversion  and  debates  about  continuity  versus  rupture;  explorations  of  how  individualism  and  sociality  interact  on  earth  and  in  the  afterlife;  the  interplay  of  public  and  private  spaces  and  constructions  of  the  secular.  This  course relies  on  in-depth  seminar  discussion   and   reading   materials   will   span   Christianity   globally,   including   Catholicism,   Pentecostalism, and Eastern Orthodoxy.

RELI 650 Women in the Hebrew Bible
Offered: 2017-18 /4
Credits: 3
Many presume to be able to identify—and easily reject-- the systemic patriarchy of biblical literature. This course aims at reintroducing the text itself and the notion of patriarchy to clarify, challenge and open up a critical discussion with individual female characters and their historic portrayal. The reading course will interrogate women’s experiences and expressions only in the narrative traditions of the Hebrew Bible. Students will be challenged to rethink accepted categories of gender and scripture. The close reading of text will require a critical consideration of narrative forms and popular renditions of said stories.
Readings and discussion will engage both feminist critical theory and Judaic tradition. A variety of Judaic approaches will be considered such as are found in classical commentaries, legends and midrashic literature. Both Judaic and feminist approaches will challenge our notions of women’s place and participation in the ancient Israelite community.
The graduate course will concentrate on one biblical book as our group project while students will choose their own character to discuss and probe. The reading course will meet bi-weekly but students will be expected to attend the undergraduate course. Each student will be required to participate in class discussions and present their own research.
Prerequisites: Permission of the instructor.

RELI 670, RELI 806 Talmud
Offered: 2017 /2
Credits: 3
The Talmud has been censored, burned, and maligned by outsiders at the same time as it has been revered by Jews for the past two millennia as one of the central texts of Judaism and Jewish tradition. Through a close reading of selected passages from the Mishnah, the Babylonian Talmud, and the Jerusalem Talmud, as well as a survey of current debates in the scholarship, we will set out the Talmud’s key components and methodologies and situate the Talmud in its ancient cultural context. By actively engaging these ancient texts, we will attempt to uncover what has given and continues to give the Talmud so much power to inspire.
The main goals of the course will be to familiarize students with this important body of literature, to situate it historically and culturally, to train students to access this body of literature on their own, and to provide the opportunity to relate it to their own area of interest. For students not primarily focused on the study of Judaism or Ancient Judaism, I add that  this course focuses on cultural historical inquiry through the reading of ancient texts and archaeological evidence. It looks at an important ancient text that goes against the conventions we typically associate with texts in the Western world, embracing conflicting voices and interpretations. Because it is remarkably different from what most students will be used to, it is particularly exciting! Please note as well that special focus will be given to issues of gender and power.
Prerequisites: It is expected that students registering for this course will have previous experience in studying Judaism, Jewish literature and/or Jewish history and be comfortable with critical theory.

ANTH 601 World Anthropologies
Offered: 2018 /4
Credits: 3
This course takes the idea of the ‘world’ as fundamental to ethnographic research. By the ‘world,’ this course refers to both the ‘public-We’ and one’s ‘own’ closest environment and to relations in-between. On this premise we will look at various case studies and ethnographic investigations in order to interrogate how it is humans experience and gain knowledge of self, Others, objects, and practices in the world. We will traverse issues ranging from globalization, development and action research to apprenticeship, psychiatry and off the grid living in a bid, on the one hand, to better understand how anthropologists generate theory about the human condition through ethnographic research and writing and, on the other, to mull over the central question of whether it is individuals who experience the world or is it subjects who are constituted through experience?

SOCI 644 Sociology of the Body
Offered: 2017 /2
Credits: 3
This three-credit course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to social theories of the body. The course consists of two key parts. In the first part, we consider a number of different theoretical trajectories (e.g., psychoanalysis, phenomenology, poststructuralism) and how they have informed contemporary scholarship on the body. In the second part, we apply these theories to a range of current issues (e.g., obesity, cosmetic surgery, erectile dysfunction, facial transplantation) as they relate to bodies and embodiments in the early post-millennium. At the intersection of cultural studies, gender studies, health studies and media studies, the course will be relevant to anyone with an interest in the mutually constitutive forces of self, body and society and how they both shape and are shaped by phenomena such as biotechnology, beauty standards and consumer capitalism.

SOCI 650 Law and the Irrational
Offered: 2017 /2
Credits: 3
Within the legal positivist tradition, law is celebrated as one of the Enlightenment’s most significant achievements leading to reason-based governance, egalitarian and impartial legislation, and a more humanitarian criminal justice system.  Indeed, it can be seen that we have come far compared to sovereign forms of violent governance against which Cesare Beccaria (1764) wrote. During this time, wrong-doing was discovered by secret accusations and inquisitorial forms of interrogation and understood as personal violation against magistrates. However, contemporary social theorists have challenged this optimism, implicating the many ways in which the so-called objective sphere of law is compromised through culture, contingency, and politics.  That is, for many thinkers the legal sphere merely conceals the reification of deep-seated social discourses that undermine this putative rationality and objectivity. This class will examine some of the sources of legal reasoning that exceed the bounds of the rational. What social and historical discourses haunt law? How does law produce and destroy subjects? Themes will consist of colonialism, space, race, animals, mechanisms of accusation, mass-incarceration, and biopolitics.

THEO 643 Saint Augustine's Confessions
Offered: 2017 /2
Credits: 3
This seminar offers an introduction to and a close reading of Augustine’s Confessions, perhaps the most famous work of Christian theology, in which Augustine narrates his early life and conversion to Christianity. Each class will focus on the historical and philosophical background to each Book of the Confessions, attending to such questions as: what is a confession and how does it relate to autobiography? How are we best to understand this text, as a work of theology, philosophy, or literature (or is that division even helpful)? It will also give students a sense of later theological and philosophical importance of particular aspects of the Confessions and of Augustine's thought.
Special instructions: Course of interest to students in Religious Studies, Philosophy, Epistemology, Literature, Classics, Ancient History.
