Research interests
My research investigates infant development, with a focus on language acquisition. I use primarily behavioral methods such as eye tracking, looking-time, sucking, and reaching measures.
I am particularly interested in infants growing up in bilingual environments and the mechanisms that they use to acquire two languages simultaneously.
Some current projects compare speech perception and word learning in monolingual and bilingual infants.
A related line of work investigates bilingual parenting, and how the language strategies used by bilingual families influence children’s language learning. We are now using our findings to detect bilingual children at risk for language impairment and delay.
I welcome e-mails from prospective MA and PhD students (applicants to either the research or the research and clinical training programs) for admission in fall 2016.
