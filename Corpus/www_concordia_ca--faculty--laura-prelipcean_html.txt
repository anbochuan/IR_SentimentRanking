Laura Prelipcean, PhD
Affiliate Assistant Professor, Classics, Modern Languages and Linguistics
Email:
I completed my PhD in Italian Studies at the University of Toronto. My thesis, “Women, Gender and Innovation in Lodovico Domenichi's La nobiltà delle donne”, analysed Domenichi’s dialogue on the nobility of women in light of its contribution to the debate surrounding women in the sixteenth century and as a reflection of his involvement with the wider cultural world of contemporary literature.
My areas of interest are early modern literature and culture, literary defences of women, women's writing, language acquisition, and technology enhanced language learning.
