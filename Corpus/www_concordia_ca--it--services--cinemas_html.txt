The J.A. DeSève is a 160-seat cinema with an adjacent foyer that is used primarily for Film Studies classes during the school year (September to April), but is available to clients on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, as well as throughout the summer. Film festivals, panel discussions and presentations are hosted in this cinema. DeSève offers digital cinema projection via a Christie CP2220 2K projector, sound via a Dolby CP650 processor (SR, A, Mono, 5.1 LPCM, 6 channel analog) reel-to-reel 35mm, 16mm and most standard video playback options in addition to a fully integrated Extron XTP retransmission network.

There is a small stage (approximately 9 by 33 feet) in front of the screen, which is suitable for tables for a panel discussion.
The cinema is not suitable for theatre and dance productions. When using the stage, it is important that the cinema screen is not touched, as the oils on a person's hands cannot be washed off the surface.
The Public Address (P.A.) system in the cinema should not be used to amplify musical instruments. If you are planning a musical performance, a separate amplification system including speakers should be rented for this purpose.

Additional technician and equipment time (for chargeable equipment) beyond the minimums will be charged at the same rate.
The projectionist or technician will arrive before show time as noted in the booking (generally 1 to 2 hours ahead of time as determined by the Booking Coordinator) to set up and check the system. The client is requested to meet the projectionist at that time with their media.
Booking categories are applied at the discretion of IITS. We reserve the right to change the client's booking category if the client/event status changes.
No taxes are charged when paid via budget code (internal) except in cases where the budget code prefix is AG.
Reduced rates can be discussed for external clients when booking multiple dates and for non-profit groups with official tax exempt status.
If other equipment is needed (i.e. laptop, microphones, etc.), further rental fees apply.
If furniture is requested, fees may apply for the delivery and/or set-up of this furniture.
Custodial charges may apply depending on whether food is served, and whether the event falls on a weekend or is followed by another booking. Please discuss this with the Booking Coordinator.
Although information may be exchanged over the phone or in person, all requests and/or changes to a booking must be made via email in order to preserve the order of all requests, and to document the progress of each booking.
After discussion of available dates and times in the cinema, the IITS Cinemas Booking Coordinator will direct the client to the r. The client follows the instructions to find availability and access the online reservation form. The reservation form, when submitted, is automatically sent to the Booking Coordinator.
Upon receipt, the reservation form will be processed and the Booking Coordinator will confirm (unofficially) that the room has been reserved. Technical and logistical details will be finalized before an estimate is sent.
If the reservation is for an internal department/group, official confirmation of the event would be pending receipt of a budget code.
If the reservation is external, the client will be asked to sign a lease agreement, and also pay the total estimated amount in advance, before receiving official confirmation. In instances where the total estimated amount of the bill is greater than $2500, a down payment of 50% of the total, or the total estimated labour charges (whichever is greater) will be necessary to confirm the booking. The balance of the amount owed will be due no later than 30 days after receipt of invoice. After the event has taken place, the client will be notified of any discrepancy between the estimated amount and the actual usage (i.e the event went longer or shorter than estimated, the client asked for extra equipment, etc.), and billed accordingly.
Clients may make tentative reservations that will be converted to confirmed bookings when the client confirms the date. A client with a tentative reservation will be asked to confirm or release the booking if another client requests the tentatively-reserved date. In this case, a hold on this date would require a non-refundable payment of 50% of the estimated room rental fee or $100, whichever amount is higher.
An external client who books DeSève Cinema for more than 2 days (e.g. a film festival or conference) will be asked to make a non-refundable deposit for the event. The amount will be 50% of the estimated room rental fee (not projectionist or equipment), plus taxes.
Requests must be made a minimum of 10 business days before the event. A booking may be cancelled without penalty up to 5 business days before the event, except for cases requiring a non-refundable deposit.
The client will be charged the room fee noted in the booking estimate for cancellations made 4 business days or less before the event.
A booking made at the minimum time allowed (10 business days or one calendar week) or less before the event CANNOT be cancelled. The required pre-payment is not refundable.
An internal client (faculty, staff, or student organization) sponsored by a department must provide the email address of the person with budget code signing authority before confirmation of the booking request.
External clients are charged external rates. Internal departments are free to sponsor external clients, though this sponsorship means only that the department will be paying the external client's invoice using a departmental budget code. Internal departments are free to sponsor an external group by paying all, or a percentage of, the client’s invoice. Students cannot sponsor external groups or organizations.
All advertising and promotional material for any event booked in DeSève Cinema cannot state or imply that Concordia University is connected with or endorses the event, unless prior permission has been given by the University. This includes naming Concordia University as part of the location address for the event. Contact the Booking Coordinator for assistance on this topic.
All signs, posters, or banners advertising an event booked in DeSève Cinema must not be placed on the exterior of any public building or on any lamppost, tree, or other object not specifically designated for public advertisements. The University reserves the right to disclose to municipal authorities the identity of the client of the event if the University is contacted about illegal signage/poster display.
Concordia University currently requires external clients who book venues on campus to have (or to procure) a public liability insurance policy in the amount of $2,000,000. Concordia University must be named as "additionally co-insured".
The University, represented by the IITS Booking Coordinator, will require a copy of this insurance policy to finalize any external lease agreement for the rental of the venue. Consult the University’s Policy Governing the Temporary Use of Space for further details.
Contact your Booking Coordinator if you have any questions regarding liability insurance.

Projectionist labour and equipment time beyond the minimums will be charged at the same rate. This will be detailed in your final invoice.
The projectionist will arrive before show time as noted in the booking details (generally 1 to 2 hours ahead of time as determined by the Booking Coordinator) to set up and check the system. Clients are instructed to meet the projectionist at that time with their media to provide ample time for tests.
External clients are required to provide proof of liability insurance, sign a standard lease agreement, and make payment for the event upfront. The IITS booking coordinator will assist with each step of the process.
Booking categories are applied at the discretion of IITS. We reserve the right to change a client's booking category if the client or event status changes.
No taxes are charged when paid via budget code (internal).
Reduced rates can be discussed for external clients when booking multiple dates.
If additional equipment is required (i.e. laptop, microphones, etc.), further rental fees may apply.
Notes:
Although information may be exchanged over the phone or in person, all requests and/or changes must be made via email in order to document the progress of each booking, and to preserve the order of all requests.
An internal client (faculty, staff or student group) who is sponsored by a department must provide the email address of the person with budget code authority before confirmation of their booking request.
External clients are charged external rates. Internal departments are free to sponsor external clients, however this sponsorship means only that the department will be paying the external client's invoice by budget code.
Students cannot sponsor external groups or organizations.
The VA-114 teaching cinema, located in the Fine Arts building at 1395 Blvd. Rene-Levesque West was renovated in the summer of 2012. The cinema seats an audience of 94 and features a ceiling-mounted projector for self-serve classroom support in addition to a Christie digital HD3K projector housed in the projection booth for cinema screenings, serviced by trained technicians. In addition to the video equipment, the cinema supports celluloid projection, both 16 & 35mm. In VA-114, the primary mandate is the support of academic activities; however, the cinema has become increasingly popular with cinema clubs and small festivals outside of the academic schedule, given its location and the professional level of audio-visual equipment offered.
Internal user: Cinema bookings may be cancelled without penalty five (5) business day prior to the event. Clients should note that late cancellations may not allow enough time to notify all personnel associated with their booking. For bookings cancelled with less than five (5) business days’ notice, clients will be charged the minimum amount for labour (projectionist; security if booked; custodial personnel if booked; etc.). Full event charges will apply for less than 24 hours’ notice.
External user: If the User cancels a Period of Occupancy less than five (5) Business Days before such Period of Occupancy, one hundred percent (100%) of the total Fees due for the Periods of Occupancy is due with the cancellation notice.
