University and Chamber Choir
December 5, 2017, 7:30 p.m. – 10 p.m.
Two choirs in one evening! Jean-Sébastien Allaire leads the largest
performing ensemble in the university in this popular concert of choral
music. The university choir, made up of students, staff and the
community, give their all to celebrate the end of the semester. Kathy
Kennedy directs the chamber choir in a program for a smaller, more
intimate choir, singing repertoire from the Renaissance to the present
day. The act of singing is one of the most unifying human abilities –
both for the singers and the audience. Listen, breathe, and enjoy.
