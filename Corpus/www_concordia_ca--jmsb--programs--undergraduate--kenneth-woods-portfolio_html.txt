Kenneth Woods Portfolio Management Program
Kenneth Woods Portfolio Management Program
Take on a real challenge - invest real money in real time
The Kenneth Woods Portfolio Management Program (KWPMP) was launched in 2000 to provide a select group of undergraduate JMSB students with hands-on training in investment management by working with a real-life portfolio of over $2.5 million.
A unique program in purpose and size, the KWPMP was established with an initial investment of $1 million by Kenneth Woods, MBA 75, in honour of the late Professor Calvin C. Potter, a much admired member of the Department of Finance who inspired a whole generation of business students.
The graduating class of 2016 added almost $120,000 worth of gains to the KWPMP portfolio during a tumultuous year. They learned lessons along the way, which will serve them well in their careers.
The incoming cohort of Fund Managers assumed the portfolio in January 2017 during a rising tide. They are not fooled by the gains offered by equities during the first quarter of the year. Due diligence and hard work to find value defines them. They too, will benefit greatly from the experience the program affords them.
2016 KWPMP annual report
In 2016, the students of the Kenneth Woods Portfolio Management Program (KWPMP) proved once again that they are up to the challenges international financial markets can impose upon them.
