Environmental Assessment (MEnv)
Environmental Assessment (MEnv)
Master of Environment (MEnv)
Offered by:

Why pursue a Master’s in Environmental Assessment?
Evaluating the environmental impacts of a project prior to its implementation is an essential part of sound decision-making. Objective assessments must identify all environmental risks associated with a proposal and offer solutions to mitigate those concerns. We need scholars to acquire a foundational knowledge in federal environmental laws and policies so they can effectively develop impact studies before prospective plans or programs are carried out.
The MEnv in Environmental Assessment provides occasions for you to establish a comprehensive approach to scoping, data collection and analysis, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). You will explore all aspects and methodologies of the environmental assessment process as you effectively analyze technical reports and oversee complex projects.
Benefit from a four-month internship where you will work under professional supervision in an environmental assessment related field. Potential placement sites include all levels of government, international agencies, non-governmental organizations and private corporations. You will also be given opportunities to improve your soft skills through a series of resumé writing and interview workshops, as well as an introduction to basic concepts of project management.

Admissions Requirements. The normal requirement for admission to the MEnv in EA is a Bachelor’s degree in an appropriate discipline in Arts or Science from a recognized university with a minimum GPA of 3.30 on 4.30. Applicants are selected on the basis of a sound undergraduate academic record and strong language skills in English and/or French which allows them to secure an internship, which is a requirement of the program. Students who lack appropriate Ecology or Geographic Information Systems preparation are required to take preparatory courses such as BIOL 205, Introduction to Sustainability; a 300-level physical geography course; or GEOG 363, Geographic Information Systems. Those lacking a social science background may be required to take GEOG 355, Resource Analysis and Management, or a similar course.
