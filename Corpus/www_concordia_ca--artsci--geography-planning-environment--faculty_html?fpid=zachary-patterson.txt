Zachary is Tier-II
in Transportation and Land Use Linkages for Regional Sustainability. He received his BA (Honours Anthropology) from McGill University in Montreal, his Master's (Economics) from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and PhD (Geography) from McGill. He was also a postdoctoral researcher at the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland in the Transport and Mobility Laboratory (). Professionally he worked as an economist at the NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation and as transportation modeler at the Montreal regional public transportation planner, l'Agence métropolitaine de transport. Zachary's research focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages. He is currently a member of the Transportation Research Board's Land Development Committee (ADD30), and of the Interuniversity Research Centre on Enterprise Networks, Logistics and Transportation ().
Teaching activities
Advanced Quantitative Methods
(Fall 2015)
Over the course of the semester, students will become familiar with the R programming environment at least for the conducting of statistical analysis, and hopefully also for data manipulation and preparation. They will become familiar with the kinds of statistical analysis that is typically used in the fields of geography, planning and environmental studies. They will also work towards understanding the type of statistical analysis that is likely to be done as part of their master’s thesis. Ideally, as part of the term project, the student will be able to work with the same data set they expect to use in the analysis for their thesis. Alternatively, another data set that resembles the data they expect to use for their thesis will be used.
It is open to graduate students. Download most recent course outline  .
Analyzing Choice
(Winter 2014)
Over the course of this class, students learn to design, implement and analyse the data, from a stated choice survey. The topic of the survey will have to do with an important environmental question. It is open to undergraduate and undergraduate students. Download the most recent undergraduate course outline .
Transportation GIS
(Winter 2016)
Download the latest .
This course introduces students to the transportation
planning and modeling process aided by the use of a
GIS-based transportation decision aid tool. A real-world
case-study region and transportation system is used
to illustrate the different elements of the planning
and modeling process. The course aims to highlight
both the strengths and weaknesses (particularly with
regards to how it treats the interaction between the
transportation system and land-use) of the traditional
transportation planning approach.

TRIP Lab
TRIP Lab Smartphone Travel Survey Platform Workshop
May 25 and 26, Concordia University
The TRIP Lab is holding a 2-day workshop on Smartphone Travel Surveys and how to use its new Smartphone Travel Survey Platform at Concordia University.
The TRIP Lab platform enables researchers to create their own free smartphone travel survey application.
The Platform is useful for anyone who wants to collect and analyze data on commuting and urban travel behaviour, including:
transportation planning authorities: transit operators, ministries of transportation, etc.
academic researchers: faculty and students from civil engineering, urban planning, geography, health, etc.
not-for-profits and community groups with a transportation focus
Registration is free, but spaces are limited.
Required: Smartphone [Android 4.1 (Jellybean, API 16) or Apple (iOS8.0 and above,  iPhone4S or newer)]
To register, please write to triplab.workshop@gmail.com
Welcome to the lab
The Transportation Research
for Integrated Planning (TRIP) Lab was founded in October 2011 as part of a
Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) grant associated with a Tier-II Canada
Research Chair in Transportation and Land-use Linkages for Regional Sustainability.
The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for
geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student
researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and
land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the
country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and
sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and
statistical analysis.
Research
in the TRIP lab focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment,
land-use and their linkages. It also involves using new technologies to collect
data on where people decide to live and how they move around the city.
Recently, a smartphone  travel survey application
and platform () has been developed to
conduct origin-destination of members of the Concordia community.
Research on urban transportation at Concordia:
