Why pursue a Master's in History?
Our MA program trains inquisitive minds for the 21st century.  The department’s mission is both to prepare historians for careers in teaching and research and produce graduates who share its commitment to serving the broader community.
As a department of world history with a strong interdisciplinary bent, we offer courses in a broad range of temporal and thematic fields, including law and society, gender and sexuality, public history and memory, genocide and human rights, and transnationalism and empire.  Our acclaimed
are engaged in interdisciplinary
and encourage student participation in research projects at the local, national, and international levels.
Benefit from our long-standing affiliation with internationally renowned research institutes dedicated to the study of public history. The , the , and the Curating and Public Scholarship Lab provide a wealth of resources for you to develop expertise as oral historian and multimedia storyteller; to communicate research findings in imaginative and unconventional ways; and to gain experience in policy making and public advocacy.
Join a student body that includes young scholars, professionals and working people who are returning to university from successful careers. The size of our MA program is one of its assets: it is large enough to allow for the creation of a collegial cohort of students and a diverse section of seminars each year, but small enough that students have generous access to their supervisors and benefit from the personal mentoring that is one of the hallmarks of our program.
