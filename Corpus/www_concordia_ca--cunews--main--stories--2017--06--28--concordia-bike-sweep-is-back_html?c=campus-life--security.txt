The annual bike sweep on Concordia’s Loyola Campus has begun.
In the coming weeks, cyclists may notice that some bikes on the campus have been tagged, which means they’ve been identified as abandoned by their owner.
On Thursday, July 13,  will remove all tagged bikes from the bike racks to make way for active cyclists to park. Confiscated bikes are held by security for a three-month storage period, after which they’re donated to a company that recycles and refurbishes them.
If your bike gets marked by mistake, simply remove the tag before the deadline.
If your bike disappears on July 13, call  at 514-848-3717.
And remember, bike racks are not meant to be used as long-term storage solutions.
