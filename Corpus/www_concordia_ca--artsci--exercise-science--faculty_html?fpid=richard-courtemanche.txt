Research
Overview
How do neurons talk to one another? Using neurophysiological techniques, students and myself aim to identify how the activity in the brain is coordinated, either in the basic rhythmicity or in a functional manner. We use recordings from many electrodes to describe brain waves and nerve cell activity. In the cerebellum specifically, it is not yet known how groups of cells interact to produce coordinated sensation and behavior. Techniques used in the lab focus on describing the underlying mechanisms shaping populations of neurons, using signals from many single units as well as field potentials in vivo in the awake or anesthetized animal.
I study the neurophysiology of neuronal oscillations, centering on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.

Biography
Fun fact
In my dreams, I play tennis really well.
Richard Courtemanche obtained his Ph.D. in Neurological Sciences (2000) from Université de Montréal, working with Dr. Yves Lamarre, and received his M.Sc. in Physical Activity Sciences (1994) from Université Laval under the supervision of Dr. Normand Teasdale. He did his postdoctoral training at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the laboratory of Dr. Ann M. Graybiel. He joined the Department of Exercise Science at Concordia in 2002, and was received as a member of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology in 2004.
