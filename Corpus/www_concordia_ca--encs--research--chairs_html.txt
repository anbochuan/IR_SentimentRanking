Hydro Québec Industrial Research Chair
Concordia University and Hydro-Québec have joined forces to establish a
new Senior Industrial Research Chair in the broad area of sustainable
energy systems. Building on the chairholder’s recent efforts in the
fields of energy efficiency, renewable energy and machine design,
innovative solutions will be developed to increase the electric
efficiency of the energy system and contribute to the conservation of
non-renewable energy sources. The Chair will further explore sustainable
and affordable energy sources suitable for Hydro-Québec customers, such
as: biomass, osmosis and small wind. The practical integration of these
sources will then be examined at particular customer locations in
settings ranging from urban office buildings to rural farms.
NSERC/Hydro Québec Industrial Research Chair
Buildings consume over half of Canada's electricity production, making
the optimized operation and improvement of energy efficiency in
buildings an important step towards reducing our use of carbon-based
energy sources. Hydro-Québec and Concordia University have joined forces
to establish a comprehensive research program in Optimized Building
Operation and Energy Efficiency. With two additional key partners –
Régulvar in integration of automation systems and CanmetENERGY in energy
efficiency – the program is expected to result in significant benefits
to Canada. Building on the Chairholder's recent efforts in the fields of
energy efficiency, smart building operating strategies and solar
buildings, new knowledge and innovative solutions will be developed to
substantially enhance building performance.
NSERC/Ericsson Industrial Research Chair
Uninterrupted service, even in the most complex software and computing
systems, has become fundamental in user expectations. Consider, for
instance, the Internet and its related servers—such as Google. End-users
require such systems to work correctly, efficiently and without any
service interruption. The NSERC/Ericsson Industrial Research Chair on
Model-Based Software Management provides strategic intelligence to the
Canadian computing and telecommunications industries. The Chair's goal
is to investigate modelling languages for platforms, requirements,
software and system characteristics. It aims to devise novel techniques
for requirement decomposition and COTS components
selection/configuration, thereby considerably improving the quality and
functionality of component-based systems.The Chair will explore new
methods to validate, deploy, monitor, reconfigure and upgrade systems
while maintaining critical characteristics—such as high availability.
The Chair collaborates closely with Ericsson—a major player in research
and development in Canada. This university-industry partnership provides
students with tangible experience at both Concordia University and
Ericsson, which which gives the students a competitive edge as they
enter the workforce and equips them with skills to strengthen Canada's
leadership in the management of software systems.
NSERC Industrial Research Chair
The NSERC Industrial Research Chair in Automated Composites
Manufacturing has for its objectives the development of composites made
using automated fibre placement (AFP) process. The supporting companies
include Bombardier Aerospace, Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Ltd.,
Composites Atlantic Limited, Delastek Ltd., and Emergia Aerospace. Other
collaborators include the National Research Council Canada, Automated
Dynamics, and CYTEC Engineered Materials. The Chair program will cover
three types of activities. The first type of activity will focus on the
manufacturing and characterization of composite laminates geared toward
the aerospace industry. Effects of different parameters—such as the
speed of manufacturing, the temperature and pressure on the quality of
the laminates—will be studied. The second type of activity will be on
the development of composite structural components that have been made
using other manufacturing techniques—such as hand lay-up/autoclave and
liquid composite moulding. Comparison will be made on the performance of
composite components made using the different techniques. The third
type of activity will be on the development of new and novel composite
structural components that can only be made using AFP. The performance
of these composite structural components will be evaluated.The Chair
results will have a strong impact on the technological advance for the
industrial partners, to a leading position of Canadian technology, and
will contribute to the improvement of socio-economic conditions in
Canada. Over the past few years, composites have been used extensively
for the manufacturing of lightweight structures—such as aircrafts,
automobiles, wind turbines, and sports equipment. The use of automation
will enhance the speed of production, improve the quality of parts,
enhance the performance, and reduce waste; thus helping to improve the
environment. Automated composites manufacturing will also provide a more
level playing field for manufacturing of composites from low
labour-cost countries and high labour-cost countries, thus helping to
keep manufacturing jobs in Canada. Lighter aircrafts would also reduce
fuel consumption, thus helping to protect the environment. Faster
production would reduce manufacturing costs and produce more
competitiveness for the companies.

In the 1990s, Dr. Vaclav Chvatal and three collaborators developed a
computer code for solving certain instances of the traveling salesman
problem. One in particular involved 15,112 cities in Germany. These
groundbreaking algorithmic techniques have the potential of being
applied to a wide class of combinatorial optimization problems, where
one aims to find the most economical option among a finite, but often
astronomically large, number of possibilities. Classical applications of
combinatorial optimization problems have been found in industrial and
management planning. The Internet Revolution and recent advances in
genomics, largely dominate recent applications. They include broadband
satellite communications, computational finance, and biotechnology.
These areas will provide test beds for software developed by Dr. Chvatal
and his research team.
End-user services (e.g. Multimedia and multiparty games, distance
learning, video on demand) are the raison d’être of communications
networks. The specification and validation of architectures for end-user
services in communication networks is a major engineering challenge.
The widest possible range of services needs to be engineered; all the
phases of the life cycle (e.g. development, deployment, execution, usage
and withdrawal) need to be addressed; and the specifics of the
communications networks need to be taken into account. This research
program focus on specification and validation of comprehensive
architectures (e.g. concepts, principles, rules) for engineering
end-user services in communications networks. The program draws on
several disciplines (e.g. distributed systems, software engineering,
networking) and deals with both conventional networks (e.g. 3G) and
challenged networks (e.g. mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensors and
actuators networks).
Dr Kishk's goal is to
develop miniaturized antennas for smart phones
that cover multiple frequency
bands and can harvest solar energy to
recharge batteries. He is also investigating how to produce affordable,
anti-collision radars for vehicles and
microwave sensors for biomedical
applications in cancer detection.
Dr. Zeng's research aims at developing robust software tools to enhance
the quality and efficiency of innovative product development in
manufacturing companies. The foundation of these tools is the formal
design science he has developed based on the recursive logic of design
he proposed with his collaborator in 1991. His research includes design
process modeling, requirements engineering, design knowledge
representation, surface reconstruction, as well as finite element
modeling. He has applied his research results to some industry projects,
such as intelligent sketching interface for product conceptual design,
integrated CAD/FEM radar analysis system, etc. Dr. Zeng and his team are
currently exploring the applications of their software tools to
manufacturing industry such as aerospace engineering, automotive
engineering, and biomedical devices manufacturing.
In aircraft jet engines, the flow of hot combustion gases can damage
internal components if their surfaces are not properly protected with a
temperature-resistant coating. Moreau’s team develops diagnostics and
modeling tools to improve coating materials and to tailor them for
optimum performance in industrial applications. His work will improve
energy efficiency and can boost economic growth in the aerospace sector.

Integration of solar energy systems into buildings has the potential to
convert them into net energy producers on an annual basis. The challenge
is to develop such buildings as advanced technological systems that are
affordable and comfortable through optimal integration of passive
systems and energy generating technologies such as photovoltaics, as
well as energy efficiency technologies. Dr Athienitis’ research work
focuses on the study, modeling and development of innovative solar
systems such as building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal systems which
generate electricity and useful heat while being a functional part of
the building envelope and its energy system; model-based design and
control of daylighting systems that include motorized shading and
transparent photovoltaics; modeling, design and control of net-zero
energy buildings. Dr. Athienitis founded the NSERC Solar Buildings
Research Network with its base at Concordia and pioneered several world
class demonstration projects of solar homes with near-zero average
annual energy consumption.
He was named by Actualité Magazine as one of
25 top innovators in Quebec.
With
the striking expansion of
information technology, security is
emerging as the most important
challenge
facing computer science and
engineering. Individuals, corporations and
organizations are relying
more and more on information systems that are
connected to public
networks, to transmit confidential and
security-critical
data. This
trend has increased the risks of interception, malicious
instrumentation and misuse of sensitive electronic information.
Accordingly,
information systems must be protected against any
malicious attempt
that may
affect secrecy (by leaking sensitive
information), integrity (by
corrupting
information), authentication
(by impersonating authorized principals),
availability (by denying
service to legal users), etc. The negative
impacts of
this situation
include: loss or endangerment of human life, financial
loss,
unauthorized
use or misuse of information, denial of services,
alteration and/or
compromise
of data or software. Our research aims at
creating dedicated processes,
methodologies, techniques and tools to
prevent attacks, reduce
vulnerabilities,
and mitigate the underlying
risks and forensically investigate cyber
incidents.
Today, many of the world's largest databases are, in fact, data
warehouses. By integrating detailed, transactional data from across the
enterprise, organizations are able to assess historical trends and plan
for the future. With the emergence of the web, however, warehouse data
volumes have grown to the point where traditional warehouse
architectures often fail to provide the kind of real time performance
that today's interactive users typically demand. Dr. Eavis' current work
focuses on a pair of related goals. In the first case, his research lab
is investigating methods that will support more intuitive analytical
services on top of the underlying warehouse repositories. Such
functionality is often broadly described by the term Online Analytical
Processing (OLAP). Specific research themes include visualization,
object oriented query facilities, query optimization, and
multi-dimensional caching. At the same time, he is targeting high
performance architectures, with a particular emphasis on cluster
computing, multi-core algorithms, and distributed grid architectures.
Research work on Materials and Composites places emphasis on the
developments of new products, processes and technologies and looking at
quality and performance issues (fracture toughness, resistance against
the absorption of small molecules such as water, alkali-water solution
and oxygen, flammability resistance) and making them more cost effective
for industrial applications be it in aerospace, automotive, biomedical
or civil engineering structures. Currently, Dr. Hoa, a leading expert in
his field of study, is focused on advances in polymer nanocomposites,
long fiber thermoplastic composites, nanomechanics of polymeric
materials, shrinkage of resin, and intelligent materials.
Minimization and avoidance of pollutant releases and understanding the
movement and transformation of contaminants once they reach the
environment, are required to avoid the degradation of the environment
and hence the ecosystem. The increasing population is leading to fewer
waste management options, environmental destruction, and increased
disasters due to global warming. Environmental management and
technological development will ultimately enhance the quality of life of
the public and the quality of the environment for the entire ecosystem.
Through this research program, Dr. Mulligan looks to develop
technologies for the treatment of air, water, waste and soil
contaminants, as well as investigate the processes for the transport and
degradation of chemicals in the complete environment across all media.
Concordia has long been known for its expertise in advanced
transportation systems and highway safety, human response to workplace
vibration and driver-vehicle interaction. Dr. Rakheja’s research work in
this area has evolved to what is called vehicular ergodynamics, a field
that involves systematic studies on the dynamics of the transport
system on the human operator, with a special emphasis on dynamic
environmental interactions. Ergodynamics addresses the mutual adaptation
of the system and the human operator, to enhance system performance and
optimal efficiency with appropriate considerations of the performance
limits of the operator. The research efforts are directed towards
developments in theories on human perception and response; effective
objective and subjective measurement techniques; considerations of
various human (age, gender, anthropometry, anthropodynamics, and
neuro-muscular response) and environmental (visibility and road
conditions) factors; vehicle dynamics and highway safety; dynamic
driver-vehicle-environment interactions; and intelligent vehicles.
Recognition technologies play an important role in information processing. Each day, billions of business and financial documents have to be processed by computers. Data needs to be captured from these documents and entered for processing. Because of the lack of computerized handwriting recognition machines, most of this data, be it an amount on a cheque or postal code, have to be entered into the computer by tedious, slow, and costly manual operations. The objective of Dr. Suen, world-renowned in his field, is to integrate several promising recognition methods, and at the same time, develop robust techniques, while discovering and applying new perceptual knowledge to improve and optimize character recognition schemes. The long-term goal is to produce an optical character and word recognition (OCR or OWR) system, which will ultimately outperform or be at least comparable to the capability of human vision.
The phenomenon of wing rock or limit-cycle oscillation that normally
occurs in aircraft is mainly due to mechanical backlash, dead zone and
hysteresis. This phenomenon is of great concern in the aerospace
industry. Extensive research has been carried out to find means of
controlling this unwanted oscillation. Mechanical backlash, dead-zone
and hysteresis that generate such oscillations fall into the general
category of non-smooth nonlinearities. They are common in the industrial
controls systems, ranging from high-technology applications
(micromanipulation in fabrication of semiconductors, ultra-precision
turning of turbine shafts, micro-stabbers and micropipettes in cellular
biology) to traditional applications (robot manipulators, and drive
systems of large vehicles). Dr. Su’s plans are to develop control
theories, engineering design methods and technology for non-smoooth
dynamic systems, arising from parameter variations or from neglected
dynamics.
The development of control methods have a direct impact on the
products being produced, and are suitable for any motion systems with
mechanical connections, hydraulic servo-valves, piezoelectric actuators,
electric servomotors, and biomedical actuator systems that require fast
and precision control.
Digital signal processing techniques have found a variety of
applications over the last 15 to 20 years in the processing of signals
in such diverse areas as biomedical image processing,
telecommunications, acoustics, image and video signal processing and
seismology. The overall objective of Dr. Swamy’s research is to develop
fundamental underlying theory for efficient and reliable processing of
speech, image and video signals, and to design algorithms for their
software and hardware implementation for communication and other
applications. Some of his current research projects include;
low-complexity speech coding; silent suppression techniques for packet
voice communication; voice activity detection using higher-order
statistics; echo cancellation, de-noising and compression of digital
images; error resilient video coding algorithms and their performance
evaluation; robust watermarking techniques using wavelets; and the
development of efficient multidimensional vector radix algorithms.
The revolution of information technology and electronics in general, is
driven by the extraordinary advances in semiconductor technology.
Today’s microelectronics systems are complex designs with literally tens
of millions of transistors on a single chip, often combining
microcontroller and DSP processor cores, memory blocks, application
specific logic and mixed-signal functions. Complexity, time-to-market
pressure and evolving requirements pose new challenges in the design and
verification process. Traditional testing such as simulation methods,
can no longer give reasonable assurance for the quality of a product.
Dr. Tahar’s research aims to develop techniques and tools enabling the
verification of real-size microelectronics designs through alternative
means, called formal methods, involving all possible scenarios of input
and state combinations, giving very strong results about the correctness
of designs. The proposed techniques will be validated using real
designs, which are industrial benchmarks. This approach will advance the
systems specification and verification process, thus shortening the
design cycle of microelectronics products.

Providing
reliable, high-speed wireless links has been a challenging
task due to the
unfriendly nature of wireless channels and the scarcity
of resources such as
frequency spectrum. Over the last decade or so,
we have witnessed a number of ground-breaking
innovations that led to
overcoming some of those challenges and forming the
nucleus of
international standards for future wireless networks such as 4G and
WiMax. However, there are still hurdles along the way to achieving the
full
potential of such networks. Another adversity of wireless systems
is the lack
of secured transmission, which poses a major obstacle for
many wireless
applications from maturing and realizing what current
technologies promise. Dr.
Ghrayeb's work focuses on developing coding
and signal processing strategies
that aim at improving the performance
of wireless systems and bridging the gap
between theory and practice.
He has been engaged in a number of multi-million
dollar projects with
collaborators from around the world. Some of the projects
he has been
involved in include cellular networks, underwater acoustic
communications, cognitive networks, and communication security.

The objectives of the proposed research are to provide
enhanced
capabilities to the command and control operators, and ultimately for
fully autonomous on-board systems in determining the most efficient
allocation,
configuration, strategies, and architectures for
cooperative fault diagnosis
and control of a network of unmanned
vehicles (UVs). The fundamental challenges
and issues envisaged are
development of novel, formal, and rigorous distributed
and
semi-decentralized methodologies for management and determination of
exchange of data, knowledge, and actions among the team of cooperating
UVs.
These goals are to be accomplished by utilizing control theories
that are
constrained by the communication network and computational
resources for
cooperative fault diagnosis and cooperative recovery and
reconfiguration
control objectives that are subject to real-time
constraints for guaranteeing
and maintaining the mission requirements.
The expected outcomes of this project will provide
rigorous solutions
to practical problems of paramount importance that is of
significant
interest to the space, robotics, marine, and aerospace industries
and
will accumulate human capital and develop sustainable research
capabilities.

Simulation of Clean Energy Production and Storage aims at developing
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) algorithms to accurately simulate the
flow in the area of wind energy and hydrogen storage.
The objectives
of the wind energy research are the development of a CFD tool that
accurately captures the physics of the flow around multiple vertical
axis wind turbines (VAWT), the analysis of the fundamental mechanisms
that increase the power coefficient of multiple VAWTs and the
demonstration of the energy extraction benefit of placing VAWTs close
together to increase the extraction of wind energy.
The main drawback with the current CFD approaches is the inability of
the CFD-RANS to capture the physics of flows which involves laminar to
turbulent boundary layer transition leading to a separation bubble.
Currently only LES solvers are able to simulate this flow but this
approach is not feasible for multiple VAWTs as it is too computationally
expensive. The ability to capture or model dynamic stall and the wake
behind the turbine needs to be developed in an RANS model.
In the area of hydrogen jets, Dr.Paraschivoiu’s research group has
developed a CFD code to examine real gas effects at high pressures when
hydrogen is released from a high-pressure chamber. The code is based on a
3-D finite volume Euler/Navier-Stokes solver, and a transport equation
is used to simulate the hydrogen concentration into air. To model
turbulence, we have developed a new adaptive upwinding scheme for Large
Eddy Simulations that works well for compressible flows. Recently, by
implementing a moving mesh methodology we have investigated the flow
behavior of jets through orifices that can change shape dynamically.
