Organized by the Refugee Centre
This is a 24h event starting November 25, 12 P.M. finishing Sunday November 26, 12 P.M..
BLOCHACKS is the first annual hackathon in the city of Montreal that is focused on mainly hacking Social Causes. We are strong believers that technology can help fix and improve the majority of disasters and social problems the world is currently facing today. We see an ever increasing gap between the Non-Profit (as well as Non-Governmental) world and current technology. Supported by the Social Innovation Catalyst known as DevBloc, we believe we can help motivate and inspire the Montreal community to build, create, structure, design, and innovate solutions to the world's more pressing issues.
You may register a team of 3 to 6 people, or register as an individual and we will team you up with others.
This is a very exciting opportunity for people to meet with big tech companies and showcase their skills all while working on something to better the lives of refugees.
