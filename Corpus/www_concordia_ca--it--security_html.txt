Be proactive about your cyber security
Criminals on the internet try to trick people out of their money and their personal information.
It’s important to always keep your computer safe, be careful what you open and be aware of the information you share.
Install good web-browsing security software and anti-virus software, such as Sophos.
Be aware that giving out your personal information email address makes you a potential target for phishing scams and emails with malicious software attachments.
Be vigilant about where your software is coming from. Do not install software applications sent by email or from a source you don’t trust.
Question before providing account information by phone, URL or email, remember that this is not how business is normally conducted.
Pay attention to sender and reply address. If they don’t match, it could be phishing.
These emails are made to look official, so it’s important to look out for spelling and punctuation. Bad grammar = likely an email you should not open.
Just because the email address says it’s from your bank doesn’t mean it is, email addresses can be faked.
Don’t open it if it doesn’t make sense. For example, if you don’t bank with RBC, then you shouldn’t have to update your information.
Were you expecting an attachment? If not, don’t open it.
