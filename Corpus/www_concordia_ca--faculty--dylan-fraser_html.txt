Research interests
Our laboratory seeks to understand how ecology, evolution and genetics interact to generate and sustain biodiversity, how human activities alter this diversity, and how this collective knowledge can be applied towards more effective biodiversity conservation in a variety of contexts. To date, this research has involved a combination of field, laboratory and molecular studies on fishes, as well as data synthesis using meta-analysis.
One of our field research sites, this one is in Yoho National Park
