Alum Philip Lanthier wins Judy Mappin Community Award
The Quebec Writers’ Federation (QWF) has named Philip Lanthier, BA (Eng.) 59, winner of the 2017 QWF Judy Mappin Community Award.
A professor, editor and festival director, Lanthier has long championed the work of Quebec English-language authors.
“I feel very pleased, honoured and happy, especially since this is the Judy Mappin Award,” says Lanthier, a graduate of Loyola College, one of Concordia’s founding institutions. “I remember her Double Hook bookstore on Greene Avenue []. Judy Mappin was always friendly and helpful, a marvelous bookstore owner, and to win this award associated with her is truly a wonderful thing.”
Lanthier has taught at Champlain College in Lennoxville, Que., and Bishop’s University in Sherbrooke, Que. In 1975, he founded Matrix, the influential literary magazine that has published generations of emerging Quebec writers for more than 40 years.
Since 2010 Lanthier has steered the Knowlton Literary Festival in Brome Lake, Que., which celebrates work written in English by local and out-of-town authors. The Montreal Gazette describes the festival as “one of the best-run and most enjoyable small-scale events of its type in Canada.”
“The festival is expanding. I’ve got a terrific team and support from the town and community,” Lanthier says. “I think championing the work of English-language authors is extremely important to the overall culture of Canada, and I am completely devoted to it.”
He adds, “I love reading Canadian poetry, Canadian novels, seeing Canadian plays. To be able to put these writers in contact with communities like the one we have in Knowlton is tremendously satisfying. It is also delightful to see how well people respond to meeting writers. Often, meeting writers in a festival setting is a revelation to people.”
Lanthier says his time at Loyola was “crucial in my development, notably two English teachers, Father Gerald MacGuigan and . They helped me develop my own writing skills and set me on my academic career.”
At Loyola he edited the Loyola News student newspaper and co-edited the literary magazine Amphora.
Lanthier is “very upbeat” about the future of Canadian literature. “It is more important than ever,” he says. “Canadian writers are crucial to our identity — who we are, where we’ve been and where we’re going. They perform an essential function by helping us discover our own history.”
Lanthier will receive his honorary award at the 2017 QWF Literary Awards event on November 21. For more information and tickets, visit .
