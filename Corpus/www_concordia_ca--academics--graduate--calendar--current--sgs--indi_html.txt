Programs
Admissions
Only outstanding applicants will be considered. Interested candidates should immediately consult the
to determine fields of study, potential supervisory committee members and other application procedures. Applicants should take note that entry to this program requires a clearly formulated program of study and the identification of a proposed supervisory committee as part of the application. (Doctoral applicants interested in pursuing a degree in inter-disciplinary studies in the areas of Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture should apply to the Humanities Doctoral Program).
The INDI Program Committee reviews all application material submitted by the applicant.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Individualized Program)
Program Requirements
The Individualized Program exists to promote innovative and creative approaches to issues that are outside the normal boundaries of investigation of existing graduate programs. Students are engaged in individualized research initiatives supported by an integrated program of study drawing on the various resources available at the University both within a Faculty or across Faculties. In most cases, individuals applying to an Individualized Program must propose a program of study involving multidisciplinary scholarship on problems that are not normally the province of disciplines represented by departments in this University. These applicants propose a supervisory committee involving faculty from at least two different departments/units. However, a limited number of students may be admitted who propose programs within a single discipline and involving faculty from only one department/unit. In all cases, applicants include a proposed supervisory committee, courses, and research plan.
Course Requirements for Students with a Pure and Applied Science, Computer Science or Engineering Concentration. Students with a pure and applied science, computer science or engineering concentration have the option of taking up to two directed research courses in fulfillment of their coursework requirements. The primary objective of such a course is for the student to acquire competencies in discipline specific research practices and/or generate useable research data under the direction of their principal supervisor.
Candidates admitted to an Individualized Program are required to conform to School of Graduate Studies regulations for graduate students.
Admission Requirements. Candidates must have completed a master’s degree or its equivalent in a relevant disciplinary area.
Credits. Candidates are required to complete a minimum of 90 credits apportioned as follows:
Coursework: 18 credits of coursework to be taken from Doctoral Level Studies INDI courses OR from any regularly scheduled graduate courses. Students must have the permission of the INDI Director to register for regularly scheduled graduate courses.
Students are required to complete a minimum of 6 credits of regularly scheduled courses.
Students must take 3 credits from a research methodology seminar in their first or second year. The 3 credits must be chosen from among the numerous courses in methodology offered by various departments at Concordia University.

Comprehensive Examination
At the doctoral level, students are required to write an examination testing their basic knowledge of the relevant areas of each component discipline comprising their program of study. The supervisory committee supplies the student with an appropriate reading list to prepare for this examination.
Students are additionally required to write a Doctoral Comprehensive Examination Essay (5000-6000 words) that integrates the component disciplines of the program of study in addressing a particular issue. The student makes a formal essay topic proposal to the supervisory committee which decides with the student boundaries and expectations for the essay. The student is then given three weeks to submit the essay.
The supervisory committee evaluates these examinations; it may, however, consult with other faculty members in relevant areas where additional expertise is required for the evaluation. The principal supervisor submits the reading list, the questions, the answers/essay, and the evaluations along with the pass/fail grade to the INDI Director.
Thesis
A thesis in an Individualized Program represents a unique contribution to scholarship undertaken while the student is enrolled in the program. The master’s and doctoral theses offered at this University in cognate areas will normally provide an appropriate guide to the format and scope of the Individualized Program thesis requirements.
In the case of a nontraditional thesis – such as one involving a creative production – the requirement of scholarly contribution still applies. Thus, while a thesis may present a creative work as its central focus, it should nevertheless provide a scholarly discussion placing that work in the context of related ideas and works. As in the case of traditional theses, the nontraditional thesis is submitted to an oral examination where it is exposed to scholarly criticism and where the student is given an opportunity to defend it.
The thesis defence must provide for the inclusion of one external examiner at the doctoral level. At the master’s level, the thesis defence will include the student’s principal supervisor and at least two other committee members, one of whom may be an external examiner.
