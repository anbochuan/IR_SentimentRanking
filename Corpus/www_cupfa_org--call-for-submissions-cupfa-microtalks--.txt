Call for Submissions: CUPFA MicroTalks
Posted on
by
Dear member,I would like to tell you about an initiative CUPFA is currently undertaking that we hope you will participate in. As you may know CUPFA has been able to support members with significant research profiles through Showcase/Special Project grants that have enabled them to produce larger-scale projects. This year CUPFA is hoping to showcase more of our members by sponsoring three evenings of MicroTalks. These will be interdisciplinary presentation events where part-time members from all Faculties can show off their research and exchange ideas.The MicroTalks will be six minutes in duration and should include both visual and oral material. We hope to highlight eight to ten members at each event, presenting material on a wide variety of interests that could include mathematics, poetry, engineering, computer science, the visual and performing arts, political science and so forth.If you would like more information about the MicroTalks and/or are interested in participating please don’t hesitate to contact me, I would love to hear from you. The coordinators and I will be more than happy to help you format your presentation.I would also like to remind members about the research@concordia website project. So far thirty part-time faculty members are included on the site. As research@concordia is about to launch a new mobile version in August this is an ideal time to sign on. When this version is open for business the University will publicize the launch and promote the site. Having good part-time faculty representation is essential! It is super easy to register:1. Log-in to your myconcordia portal (), go to the MyResearch@Concordiasection and complete the registration form.2. Don’t forget to schedule an appointment with David Ward for a photo session. You will find the online calendar on the registration form.If you haven’t already had a chance to look at the site go to: I am always interested in receiving news and feedback from you. I would be delighted to hear suggestions, comments and/or questions you may have about these or other concerns regarding Professional Development.Lorraine Oades
