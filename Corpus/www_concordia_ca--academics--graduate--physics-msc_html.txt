Why pursue a Master’s in Physics?
The basic laws of physics are applied in advancements in many areas including modern medical and space-related technologies, climate research as well as energy generation and storage. As the study of physics continues to evolve through new discoveries, we need inquisitive minds to explore the connections between traditional and emerging research areas, including medical and nano-scale physics, and biophysics.
The MSc in Physics provides you with broad degree training for you to investigate fundamental and applied concepts that reflect
research specializations. Our cross-listed faculty members are experts in fields as varied as bioengineering and chemistry, and contribute to an environment that stresses strong student-supervisor relationships. For example, in collaboration with the , biomedical physics-related projects include using different imaging technologies to improve medical diagnostics and to investigate the effects of exercise on aging.
Benefit from cutting-edge
that promote interdisciplinary collaborations in nanoscience, and the molecular and life sciences. For example, projects currently underway at the
examine the optical properties of nanomaterials, the link between light-induced electron transfer and accompanying protonational reactions, and the structure-function relationships in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes.
Our MA students are looking at topics such as:
electrochromic properties of vanadium pentoxide thin films
fabricating optical devices using a only optical fibre and a  hydrogen-oxygen torch
the optical properties of photonic crystal ring resonators
using a writing-to-learn tool to engage students’ scientific thoughts at a higher level
the physics of manganese as a secondary electron donor in native bacterial reaction centers.
