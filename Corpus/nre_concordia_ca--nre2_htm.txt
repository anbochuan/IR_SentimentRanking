relevant to rural society:
communications, environment,
services, and governance. It is
grounded in five years of research
initiated by the Canadian Rural
Revitalization Foundation under
the title Understanding the New
Rural Economy: Options and Choices
(NRE).
The
new project (NRE2) will include an
education component that is
integrated with the research.
Rural citizens will learn how to
conduct research, interpret the
results, and take appropriate
action. Policy makers will benefit
from scientifically collected and
analyzed data to inform and direct
their decisions.

The New
Rural Economy Project
Phase 2 (NRE2)
is a research and education
program studying rural Canada
since 1998. It is a
collaborative undertaking
bringing together rural people,
researchers, policy-analysts,
the business community, and
government agencies at all
levels to identify and address
vital rural issues. It is
conducted at the national level
with historical and statistical
data analysis, and at the local
level with case studies
involving community and
household surveys. The NRE's
mandate has been extended
through 2006 with the help of a
major grant from the
Program
(INE) of the Social Sciences and
Humanities Research Council of
Canada.
The NRE
Project is an initiative of the Canadian Rural
