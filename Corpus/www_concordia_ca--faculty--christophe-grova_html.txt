Research interests
Pr. Christophe Grova is directing , a multidisciplinary team composed of neurologists and methodologists, investigating
multimodal data fusion to characterize brain mechanisms in healthy conditions and also during epileptic activity.
Being affiliated to both Biomedical Engineering and Neurology and Neurosurgery Departments at McGill University since July 2008, Dr. Grova investigates the integration of multimodal functional data to study brain mechanisms at the time of epileptic activity. His research project aims at combining multimodal data in order to detect additional information that could be missed by considering each modality individually. His project involves the integration of three promising functional modalities:
Simultaneous ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) - MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) acquisitions, measuring directly on the scalp electric and magnetic components of epileptic signals generated by neurons synchronously active (at a ms scale). Source localization procedure is then required to localize the generators of these discharges within the brain.
Simultaneous EEG - functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI acquisitions to measure, within the whole brain at a second scale, hemodynamic responses that correlate with epileptic discharges detected on scalp EEG.
Simultaneous EEG - Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) acquisitions to measure local changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the time of epileptic discharges detected on scalp EEG, by exploiting absorption properties of infrared light within brain tissues using optic fibres placed on the surface of the head.
The comparison of EEG/fMRI and EEG/NIRS offers a unique way to address in vivo the question of the integrity of the neurovascular coupling in the epileptic brain. In addition of studying brain mechanisms at the time of epileptic discharges, Dr. Grova is currently applying similar methodologies to study resting state functional connectivity in epilepsy patients.
In July 2014, Christophe Grova became
an assistant Professor in the Physics Department and a researcher in the brand new multimodal imaging platform of the
at Concordia University, while remaining an adjunct Professor in . This new imaging platform of PERFORM is equipped with a 3T MRI, simultaneous SPECT/CT and PET/CT devices, TMS and high density MR compatible EEG. His research projects are about to evolve to incorporate these new modalities, in order to study epileptic activity, but also many other applications in neurosciences including healthy aging, exercise and multimodal analysis of resting state functional connectivity.
