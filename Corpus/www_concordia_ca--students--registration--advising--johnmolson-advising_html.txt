Common registration issues
BTM 200 is an online course, this is why there is no classroom included in the course listing. Do not try to register for the in-class section of BTM 200 unless the terms of your government financial aid prohibit you from online learning.
You should always register for all available terms as early as possible. Fall and Winter courses should be selected at the same time.
When selecting courses, you must register for prerequisite or co-requisite courses before higher-level courses, especially when you choose to complete co-requisite courses in the same term.
Example: you must register for COMM 205 before COMM 210, even if you choose to complete these two courses in the same term, because COMM 205 is a pre- or co-requisite for COMM 210. If you try to register for COMM 210 before COMM 205, the system will block you and show an error message telling you that you do not have the prerequisites completed.
Example: you must complete COMM 205 and 210 before registering for COMM 222, however, you are permitted to register now for COMM 205, then 210, in your first term and then register for COMM 222 in your second term because the system recognizes that the prerequisites are expected to be completed by the time you begin COMM 222.

Returning JMSB Students
Students are urged to register for both Fall and Winter courses according to the registration start dates indicated in the  for Fall 2017 and Winter 2018. Start dates are also provided to students through the  Portal.
Failure to register for both Fall and Winter terms as early as possible may result in an unfavourable schedule or in extreme cases the unavailability of required courses. No special arrangements will be made if you delay your registration.
Program Planning Worksheets for all undergraduate programs offered by the JMSB are available on the JMSB website. Program Planning Worksheets allow students to track their progress in their program and facilitate course selection for future registration. Please visit  to print a copy of the worksheet for your specific JMSB program. You will not be able to proceed with your registration if you attempt to bypass any of the following academic regulations:
register for courses prior to your registration start date;
register for a course before completing the listed prerequisites;
register for a course concurrently with the listed prerequisites;
register for more than your allowed course load;
register for a course that is restricted to specific Majors and/or Minors, other than your own.
Registration for Summer Courses
Due to limited course selection in the Summer terms, students may not be able to register for a full course load. Hence, you are strongly encouraged to register as early as possible. Please see the  for Summer 2017.
Non-business Students
Students not enrolled in a program offered by the JMSB may register for a maximum of 6 business credits per term for an overall total of 30 business credits.
NOTE: The 30 credits include failed courses. Priority for registration is given to current JMSB students over non-business students. As such, space may not be available for all non-business students wanting to register in specific business courses.
