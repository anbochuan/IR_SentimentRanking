MSc/PhD IN INORGANIC PHOTOCHEMISTRYDeveloping photoredox catalysts for solar fuels generation and surface functionalization
About the research
Dr. Marek Majewski is seeking a student applying to either an MSc or PhD in Concordia University’s Chemistry program to begin work on developing new molecular materials for solar fuels generation and photocatalytic surface functionalization.
Research in Dr. Majewski’s group focuses on developing inorganic materials for catalyzing light-driven processes. Research thrusts include the development of photocatalysts for solar fuels generation (i.e. water oxidation or CO2 reduction), organic transformations, and surface functionalization. The appointed M.Sc./Ph.D. student will work primarily to develop photocatalysts that undergo single electron transfer to drive small molecule activation and polymerization catalysis.
The work is highly interdisciplinary with roots in chemistry, physics, and materials science and will be part of a new research program at Concordia University in the
supported by state-of-the-art facilities including the . Candidates will have the opportunity to work with other researchers at Concordia and in the Montréal area.
Financial commitment
The selected candidates will receive a funding package comprised of Research Assistantship Bursaries, Teaching Assistantships, and entrance awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship ($32,400), Merit Scholarship ($10,000), Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD - $35,949), and the Out-Of Province Tuition Remission (Masters - $6,000).
Requirements
The candidate should hold a degree in chemistry, materials science, or a related field. The candidate is expected to be a motivated, enthusiastic and independent researcher with a strong background in inorganic chemistry or photochemistry. An understanding of ground and excited state spectroscopies, catalysis, and inorganic/organic synthesis are assets.
