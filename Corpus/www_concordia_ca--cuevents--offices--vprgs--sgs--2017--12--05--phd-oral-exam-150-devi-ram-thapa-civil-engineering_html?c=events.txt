PhD Oral Exam - Devi Ram Thapa, Civil Engineering
Characteristics of Flow past Warped and Wedge Transitions
December 5, 2017, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m.
When studying for a doctoral degree (PhD), candidates submit a thesis that provides a critical review of the current state of knowledge of the thesis subject as well as the student’s own contributions to the subject. The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.
Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.
Abstract
Expanding channel transitions link the subcritical flow emerging from reservoirs to narrow concrete rectangular channels connected to very wide trapezoidal earth channels of irrigation networks. The present study includes the effects of various design changes in warped and wedge transitions on the behavior of flow emerging from transitions. The efficiency of a good transition is measured in terms of its ability to provide a low value for the maximum velocity and a nearly uniform velocity distribution at the transition exit section. Also, a well-designed transition reduces an energy loss in the transition and ensures that the secondary flow intensity in the downstream trapezoidal channel is low enough to avoid the channel boundary erosion. The study indicated that the changes made in the design of the warped and wedge transitions did achieve these stated objectives. The mean velocity of the flow gets reduces continuously along the axis of the expanding channel transition. This leads to flow separation from the sidewalls of the transition and the formation of turbulent eddies which can result in significant head losses and increase the risk of eroding the downstream channel.
A Laser Doppler Anemometer was used to measure the flow velocity. The point measurements were non-intrusive, and provided a three-dimensional distributions graph of the mean flow velocity as well as the intensity of turbulent fluctuations. The data determined by LDA as well as the depth data form point gauge measurement yielded the longitudinal flow profile and the maximum velocity ratio, as well as the head loss in the transition and the intensity of secondary flow. Flow separation characteristics were recorded by tracing the separation zone and the points of reattachment based on velocity data. These were confirmed by visual observation involving dye tests. The information provided assists field engineer to design efficient transition, which ensure that channel system has a high command of the form land in field installation. Simple appurtenances such as vanes in warped transition and short streamlining strips along the diagonal of wedge transition were shown to be effective in improving the transition efficiency measured in terms of reducing flow separation and conserving energy.
The 3-D model tested was successful in quantifying the effects of vanes in warped transitions. To simulate the complex flow in the warped transition, RNG k-ε and RSM models were adopted and the results were validated by using the available experimental data for a warped transition. It is shown that the use of a vane effectively reduces flow separation and eddy motion in the transition and downstream channel.
