Concordia Student Exchange Program
Are you a current Concordia student who would like to study abroad? If so, the following section of this website is for you and covers information on eligibility requirements, how to apply, Concordia's international student exchange partners, funding and everything else you need to know about CSEP!
The Concordia Student Exchange Program (CSEP) is a study abroad program that allows Concordia students to spend 1-2 semesters abroad at one of our 130+ partner institutions around the world while paying regular Concordia tuition fees, and earning credits towards their degree back home. Concordia International further facilitates the exchange process by helping students apply for bursaries that make studying abroad even more affordable.
