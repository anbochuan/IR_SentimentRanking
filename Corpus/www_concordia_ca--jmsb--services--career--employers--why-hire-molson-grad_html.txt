Why you should hire a JMSB grad
Why hire a JMSB student or graduate?
The John Molson School of Business (JMSB) is proud to be the first business school in Montreal to receive accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), thus positioning ourselves with other leading business schools such as Harvard, Wharton and Northwestern.
JMSB offers over 70 years of superior management education and is among the largest English language business schools in Canada, with over 8,000 students enrolled at both graduate & undergraduate levels. As a key part of one of Canada’s most multicultural universities, JMSB truly represents the spirit of Concordia: a diverse student body (comprised of representatives from 160 countries) with a range of backgrounds, relationships with international partners, and a strong academic base founded on principles of high achievement and career preparation.
At JMSB we prepare graduates for long and successful careers in business and administration, and we educate them to become responsible global citizens.
