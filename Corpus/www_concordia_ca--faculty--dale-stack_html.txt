Research interests
My research program focuses on the development and trajectories of children at low and high risk for developmental problems and psychopathology, and on infant development (typical and at-risk). Parenting, parent-child relationship, quality of interactions, and developmental outcomes in several groups of at-risk dyads, including a sample crossing two generations, are being studied.
Foci in ongoing studies include: (1) intergenerational transfer of psychosocial risk; (2) long-term outcomes of childhood aggression and social withdrawal; (3) the development of very low birth weight preterm infants, (4) early health and development, risk and protective factors; (5) parent-infant social interactions and infants' socio-emotional development.
I am also involved in studies examining the roles of touch and gesture, modality, non-verbal communication and context in parent-infant interactions.   Specific research projects are funded by SSHRC, FQRSC and CIHR.
