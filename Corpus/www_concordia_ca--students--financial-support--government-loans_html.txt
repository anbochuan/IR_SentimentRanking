Government student aid programs
The Financial Aid and Awards Office helps students work with their government’s student financial aid program in order to pursue studies at Concordia. One very important thing to remember regardless of the program you are applying to:  students must apply every year and apply early – a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks before the beginning of the semester in order to receive their funding in time for the start of term.
Don’t wait – follow the links below to find your government’s program and get started:

Notice of AFE update
We would like to inform you of an AFE service upgrade for students borrowing through AFE’s full time student loan program.  Effective May 16th, 2016 students who are full time or deemed full time will have direct access to their Certificate of Guarantee through their AFE online portal.  As a reminder, the Certificate of Guarantee is your loan agreement with the government and your financial institution and is required to obtain your loan.
To obtain and print your Certificate, log on to your Aide Financière aux Études online portal.  In the “Notice” section of your file, a message will indicate that a Certificate of Guarantee has been issued as a result of a full-time status confirmed by your school. It will direct you to print your Certificate. Once you have printed your Certificate, you can present it to one of the participating financial institutions in order to complete the loan process.
Certificates of Guarantee for students borrowing through AFE’s part time student loan program will continue to be sent in paper format to the university.
For more information, please
