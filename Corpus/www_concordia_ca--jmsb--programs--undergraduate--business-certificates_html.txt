Certificate in Business Studies
The 30-credit undergraduate Certificate in Business Studies is designed for students seeking a basic understanding of contemporary business practices. The Certificate is not a Bachelor's Degree, but the program does include credited undergraduate business courses.
Certificate in Foundations for Business
This 30-credit undergraduate certificate program caters to students who wish to develop the necessary background for further study in undergraduate degree programs in Business. It also may be of interest to students whose preference is to follow a short program of study or to learn important foundations for business studies.
Certificate in Accountancy
The Certificate in Accountancy is designed to provide interested candidates with an opportunity to earn a certificate while they are completing the qualifying undergraduate requirements for the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation in Quebec.
This program is only open to Canadian citizens, landed immigrants and permanent residents of Canada who hold a Bachelor’s degree, in any subject other than Accountancy, and can only be completed on a part-time basis.
