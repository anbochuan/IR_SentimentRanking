Research interests
We aim to understand multilingual development and the implications this has for individual and society. For this we look at the interactions between cognition,communication and culture. Our work includes investigating the cognitive & psycholinguistic  processes underlying multilingualism, the role of communication networks in multilingual development, the role of language identity in multilingual development, the social-motivational aspects of language development,role of language in acculturation and psychosocial well-being. In focusing on the interactions among cognition, communication and culture, we use a variety of techniques and methods. These include laboratory-based cognitive and perceptual tasks, tasks designed to reveal aspects of oral fluency, data collection based on questionnaires and surveys, and field studies of communication.
