Offered by:

Why study Leisure Sciences?
Design community programs and activities that help people improve their quality of life and health and have more fun. In a culture that values productivity and work, recreation plays a key role in maintaining a healthy work­­–life balance. When you study Leisure Sciences, you learn administrative and programming skills that help you develop leisure programs for all ages.
The curriculum straddles the classroom and the community; real-life experiences give you the opportunity to hone your leadership and teamwork skills. You’ll also:
Apply social psychological theories to the practice of leisure programming and administration
Assess community leisure needs and find creative solutions for meeting them
Learn to coordinate and execute special events, recreation and leisure programs for the community-at-large
Engage in fieldwork with community organizations to evaluate the success of recreation and leisure programs
Concordia’s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for future graduate studies in such fields as recreation and leisure studies, community or organization development, and public or business administration. Students graduate with transferable skills that bring about empowerment, self-management and effective teamwork in rapidly changing workplaces.
