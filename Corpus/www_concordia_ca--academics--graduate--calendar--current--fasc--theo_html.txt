THEO 603 Method in Theology (3 credits)
This course introduces students to theological method: the questions, insights, and philosophical presuppositions that determine theological frameworks with some attention to modern systematic theology and Christian ethics. Students acquire a differentiated appreciation for the types of theology, the scope of distinct theological fields, and their research horizons.
THEO 604 Theological Hermeneutics (3 credits)
This course introduces students to the notion of church as interpretative community, and to experience diverse ways of utilizing this notion. Students develop an understanding of the basic principles of theological hermeneutics (the science or theory of interpretation), including a survey of the history of the disciple from early times up to present day.
THEO 605 Methods in Biblical Studies (3 credits)
This course focuses on tools and methods employed in biblical studies and ancient literature related to the Bible (up to 600 CE). Synchronic and diachronic approaches are discussed but the course focuses primarily on diachronic methods (form and genre criticism, comparative method, etc.) Students are trained to develop skills in analyzing texts using biblical methods.
THEO 690 Annotated Bibliography and Thesis Proposal (6 credits)
The annotated bibliography and thesis proposal constitute preliminary phases necessary for the writing of the MA thesis. The annotated bibliography and thesis proposal are supervised by the supervisor of the thesis and are assessed on a pass/fail basis.
Note: Students who have received credit for THEO 685 or 695 may not take this course for credit.
THEO 691 Research Paper (9 credits)
The guided research project involves the preparation of a substantial research paper. It may be prepared in conjunction with any seminar course but will be separate from the basic course requirements.
THEO 692 Applied Project in Theology (9 credits)
The aim of this course is to give the student the opportunity to engage in critical theological reflection by frequenting a milieu where theological interpretation occurs on a regular basis (e.g. a local parish, a confessional school, a religious formation program like the Christian Training Program, religious programming in the media, etc.) in order to assess the theological models presupposed in the activity studied. The practicum will include a 3 credit reading component related to the field of study.
THEO 697 Thesis (21 credits)
The thesis shall consist in the presentation of the research results. Each thesis shall be examined by a committee consisting of the student’s supervisor and by at least two other scholars from the Department. The remaining regulations concerning the thesis examination are in accordance with the School of Graduate Studies (See ).
