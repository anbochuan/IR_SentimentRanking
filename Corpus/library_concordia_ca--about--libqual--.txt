libraries that measures the quality of library services. It is completed by students and

from various countries have participated in this survey since 2000.
The goals of LibQUAL+ are to:

excellence in providing library service

Collect and interpret
library user feedback systematically over time
Provide libraries with
comparable assessment information from peer institutions
