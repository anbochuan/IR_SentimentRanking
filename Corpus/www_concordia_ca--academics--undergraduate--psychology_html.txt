Why study Psychology?
Modern scientific psychology studies brain processes and behaviour — both human and animal — under various conditions. Psychologists study the relationships between the brain and behaviour: the processes that determine how we learn to speak, create and keep memories, or respond to stress. When you study psychology, you examine the internal and external factors that influence development, cognition, perception and motivation.
All Psychology students follow a core psychology curriculum. Regardless of your program you’ll also:
Receive fundamental training in statistics and research methods
Learn the basic principles of behavioural neurobiology
Study the history of psychology
A Psychology degree opens many doors; specialization or honours students may choose to work as a psychologist, therapist, or pursue graduate studies or medical research. Students majoring in Psychology can complement their studies in other fields such as business, communications or education.
Program details
A Bachelor of Arts or Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, .
Program options:
Honours in Psychology (66 credits)
Students seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in the program, to the departmental honours advisor, normally following the completion of 30 credits.
Specialization in Psychology (60 credits)
This program is similar to the BA Honours Program, but without research experience in psychology, the honours seminars and the honours thesis. The number of electives at the intermediate or advanced level in psychology is increased to 12, for a total of 60 psychology credits, leaving 30 open elective credits, 24 of which should be in departments other than Psychology (6 of which must be General Education credits*).
Major in Psychology (42 credits)
The Major consists of 42 credits in Psychology and is relevant for someone seeking a good general degree which could have applications in a variety of fields related to teaching, business, personnel, or community involvement.
