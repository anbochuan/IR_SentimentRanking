Spring cleaning has begun and so has Concordia’s annual bike sweep.
In the coming weeks, cyclists may notice that some bikes on campus have been tagged, which means they’ve been identified as abandoned by their owner.
On May 10,
will remove all tagged bikes from campus racks to make way for active cyclists to park.
Confiscated bikes are held by security for a three-month storage period, after which they’re donated to a company that recycles and refurbishes them.
If your bike gets marked by mistake, simply remove the tag before May 10.
If your bike disappears on May 10, call
at 514-848-2424, ext. 3717.
And remember, bike racks are not meant to be used as long-term storage solutions.
