Decriminalization or Legalization: How do we address the impact of drugs in our lives and communities?
December 1, 2017, 12 p.m. – 2 p.m.
Our University of the Streets Café public conversations are much like any you’d have with friends or family around a dinner table, except with more people, more points of view, and slightly more structure. Conversations are hosted by a volunteer moderator who is there to welcome everyone and keep things on track. To get things started, there’s a guest, or sometimes two, who get the ball rolling by sharing their ideas, experiences and questions. After that, it's all up to the participants.
Are we ready to move towards decriminalizing drugs in Canada? While Canada recently legalized marijuana, Prime Minister Trudeau has indicated he is not prepared to go further and legalize or decriminalize any other drugs. Our country is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis of overdose, where this year we will see the deaths of 3000 people due to opioid overdose.  Harm reduction advocates have been calling for the decriminalization of all drugs and to end the war on drugs as a way to effectively address the opioid overdose crisis. But moralism, fear and stigma towards drugs and the people who use them continue to stand in the way of sensible policy. This interactive conversation will discuss examples of drug legalization, decriminalization and the impacts of the ongoing war on drugs to address the pros and cons of different approaches.
