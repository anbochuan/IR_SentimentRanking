Harriet Petrakos, PhD
Associate Professor, Education
Email:
Dr. Petrakos is a school psychologist whose research interests center on
the reciprocal influences of home and school on children's development.
Children's social, emotional and cognitive outcomes are studied across
different contexts (home, school, community). Her research on family
relationships focuses on parent-child dyadic interactions (i.e., verbal
and physical exchanges, initiations and responsiveness, directiveness
and encouragement of autonomy). Her research on family-school
collaboration examines the variability in belief systems between
settings (home, school) and their effects on children's behavior and
academic performance. More specifically, parent-teacher interactions,
teacher-child relationships and peer socialization experiences are
examined as promoting resiliency or risk for children and their
families.
