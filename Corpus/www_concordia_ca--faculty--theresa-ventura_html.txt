Theresa Ventura holds an MA and PhD in History from Columbia University and a BA in History and women's studies from Brooklyn College.  Her research draws together the histories of United States foreign relations, medicine, agriculture, and the environment.  Her current manuscript, tentatively titled Empire Reformed:  The United States, the Philippines, and the Practices of Development, investigates American attempts to recast rural life and agricultural production in the Philippines, then the United States' most populous formal colony, and considers the impact of this project on Philippines politics, health, and nature.  The manuscript is a revision of her dissertation, which was awarded Columbia University's Bancroft Dissertation Prize (2010).  Before coming to Concordia, Dr. Ventura was an Assistant Professor at Wake Forest University, North Carolina, and was a 2010-2011 American Council of Learned Societies-Mellon Foundation Post-doctoral fellow at the John W. Kluge Center, Library of Congress, Washington DC.
She has published in Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints and has a forthcoming article in Agricultural History.
