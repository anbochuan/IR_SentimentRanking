Transfer credits
While completing a degree in the Faculty of Arts and Science, a student may wish to take a course at another Quebec institution or at another university outside of the province.

The Faculty does not guarantee the number of credits that will be transferred into the student's program or degree prior to enrolment.
Note: The Faculty does not guarantee that credits taken elsewhere will be transferred and counted toward a degree if the student does not have prior permission.
