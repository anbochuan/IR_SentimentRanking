MSc/PhDIN POLITICAL SCIENCEThe Politics of ‘Doing’: Policy Work and Gender-Based Analysis in Canada
About the research
Drs. Stephanie Paterson and Francesca Scala are offering two two-year PhD Fellowships in Gender Mainstreaming with a minimum value of $50,000, to commence in September, 2018. The doctoral research fellows will assist with the project The Politics of ‘Doing’: Gender-Based Analysis and Policy Work in Canada. Funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), this project investigates the ways that feminist knowledges mediate bureaucratic practices in Canada, with specific focus on gender-based analysis at both federal and provincial levels.
The doctoral research fellows will play an important role in the research project and have the opportunity to co-author with members of the project team and present at conferences, while also conducting their own independent research. Additional funding for conference travel may be available throughout the course of the project. The fellows will also be active members of the Gender Matters Policy Research Lab (GMPR), a vibrant community of researchers dedicated to the study of gender and public policy.
Financial commitment
The selected candidates will receive a generous funding package that should exceed $25,000 per year for two (PhD) years of the program. The offer includes a Research Assistantship Bursary, and a Teaching Assistantship. In addition, all applicants are considered for additional entrance awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowships of $32,400, and Merit Scholarships of $10,000. Applicants will also be considered for tuition remissions, including the Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD) valued at $35,949.
The successful candidates will have many opportunities to present at conferences, write articles and disseminate their research.
Requirements
Candidates should hold a master’s degree in political science, policy studies, or related discipline. Candidates should be familiar with qualitative research methods, particularly discourse and narrative analysis. Applicants should also have a broad research interest in feminist policy studies, with a specific focus on equality policy architectures and/or gender-based policy analysis.
