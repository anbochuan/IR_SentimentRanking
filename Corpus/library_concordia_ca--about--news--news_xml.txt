http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i10_Oct_2017_12:20:56_EDT
Speaker: Ruolin Wang, Technology Sandbox Assistant
Sketchup is a popular 3D modeling software which has a wide range of uses in architectural design, interior design, civil and mechanical engineering. Compared to other 3D modeling software, Sketchup is easily to learn and supported by a friendly interface. Compelling walkthroughs, house staining and detailed models can be created in this software; Sketchup files can also be exported to other simulation software, such as Energy Plus, Wufi, Transys and others.
This workshop will get you started on the right foot with Sketchup! We will look at basic commands to model the interior and exterior of buildings, and model a quick example. Finally we will look at some useful Sketchup plugins, for example one plugin makes it simple to 3D print your creation.
Please bring a laptop with Sketchup installed on it. You can install Sketchup beforehand (30-day trial) using this link:
Open to everyone. 120 minutes.

This is nerdy-math-crafting like you have never seen it before!
Drop by the Technology Sandbox in November to learn how to crochet a model of hyperbolic space. This is nerdy-math-crafting like you have never seen it before! Warning: other mathematical models may also be explored, and you may leave with a greater appreciation for the connection between textiles and computing. We will teach you a little bit about hyperbolic space and the basic crochet stitches to get started. Drop by from 2 - 3:30 p.m. on November 8-10, 13-14, or 16-17 to get expert assistance with your project. Basic supplies provided and no prior crochet or math skills required!

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i6_Oct_2017_12:30:54_EDT
As our sex lives increasingly play out in the digital world, how do we adapt safe practices to screens and code? This sex-positive workshop will give you practical tips for preserving your privacy online by breaking down the pros and cons of various applications used for sharing pictures and chatting, and videocalling. The idea is to empower us with a clearer understanding of the potential risks and ways to mitigate them, in continuity with sex ed for in the analogue world.
As a bonus, the takeaways from this digital hygiene crash course extend beyond your intimate life.
This workshop is presented by the Tiger Lotus Coop . Speakers will be Maroussia Lévesque and Tina Salameh.
Maroussia Lévesque is a lawyer and researcher at the crossroads of law and technology, with a background in interactive arts. She lead teams of designers, artists and programmers for the Obx lab for experimental media at the Hexagram research-creation institute. She was called to the Quebec Bar in 2013 and clerked at the Quebec Court of Appeal for the Chief Justice. She was the intelligence analyst at the Quebec inquiry commission on the protection of journalists’ sources, examining law enforcement’s electronic surveillance practices. She currently focuses on algorithmic fairness and is a member of IEEE’s working group on algorithmic accountability.
Tina Salameh is a Computational Arts double major Concordia alumna. She has spent the past 8 years working in startups, walking the lines between Art, Design and Technology. In her free time, she fights for freedom of speech and digital rights in the Middle East and runs workshops on digital privacy.
She loves things that are open source and things that are playful (and cats with laser eyes). She’s currently helping the Library build the Visualization Studio -- a space for interactivity, immersion, data visualization, research and many other endeavours.
While this is a free is event there is a $5 suggested donation.

Booked 5
The book works in this year's installation of BOOKED include a diverse range of one-of-a-kind objects produced by students in the course DART 280 – Investigations in Typographic Design
taught by Pata Macedo.
Centered on the theme of Winter in the world we live in, the book format provides a space for students to bring together narratives and imagery with various techniques including printmaking, graphic design and typography, bookbinding, photography, textiles or sculpture. These disparate constructions underline the boundless possibilities inherent in the book format, offering a multilayered reading experience for the viewer.

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i15_Feb_2017_14:20:43_EDT
The third of four phases of the Webster Library
Transformation will be complete once LB-2 West reopens to the public on
Wednesday, February 22 at 9 a.m. Earlier this year, LB-2 East and the Library’s
main staircase reopened.
Temporary closure of Webster LibraryIn order to move the Library’s Circulation
Desk, Reference and Information Desk, and the Interlibrary Loans department to
LB-2, the Webster Library will close on Sunday, February 19 at 11 p.m. and
reopen on Wednesday, February 22 at 9 a.m.  We chose to do this during
Reading Week to lessen the impact on students. The
and
the
will have regular opening hours during
that time.
Restoration of permanent main entranceWith this reopening, entrance to the Webster
Library will return to its permanent state. Students will enter the library
from the main staircase and be able to take internal Library stairs or
elevators to higher floors. This will reduce the crowding of the elevator on
LB-1 and the fire escape stairways will no longer be needed.
New service pointsWhen visitors enter the Library from the main
staircase, they will be greeted immediately by the new service area for
This is a re-visioning of our former Information and Reference Desk
and will be the new place to go for help in the Library. In fact, three
services will be offered at the Ask Us desk:
General
and directional information and basic reference
Reference
questions and research assistance
Technical
questions relating to equipment and software.
Also coming to LB-2 is the new Loans & Returns
desk, a permanent installation of the former Circulation Desk. Book displays
and self-checkout machines will be nearby.
The Interlibrary Loans department will have a
new permanent home on LB-2 as well.
Technology focusA brand new service will be launched on February
22: the . It's a place for the Concordia community to try out emerging
technologies and cutting-edge equipment. Learn about 3D printing, electronics,
or digital music by attending a workshop. Work on your personal tech project,
explore virtual reality with headsets we provide, or tell our digital die
cutter to print your vinyl decal. It's a community technology space where
everyone can learn by doing, by making, by playing, and by sharing knowledge
with each other. .
Exciting new technologies will be added to the
Library on LB-2: the , digital signage and
wayfinding kiosks, and an immersive .
In the next few weeks, an additional group
study room and classroom will be opening on LB-2 West.
Art is another focus on LB-2, with a new space
for exhibitions in the Library as well as a renewal of the
from 1992.
What’s next? Phase 4/4 is underway since
December 2016. LB-4 is currently closed in order to complete renovations. LB-3
West will be closing shortly for renovations. The Webster Library Transformation will be complete at the end of 2017.

Raspberry Pi 101: Cat selfie machine
http://library.concordia.ca/help/workshops/technology-sandbox.php?guid=raspberry-pi
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i15_Feb_2017_12:20:38_EDT
A Raspberry Pi is a very small computer; so what can you do with it? Lots of things, but once you experience the magic of your cat (or dog, or goldfish!) sending you selfies you will start to get a feeling for how to put this tiny, inexpensive computer to work in both practical and fanciful ways. This is a good workshop for starting with a Raspberry Pi. No pet ownership actually required. Laptop recommended.

Webster Library Exhibition: Lori Beavis - Cultural Collateral: identity, community and belonging

Lori Beavis
Cultural Collateral: identity, community and belonging
December 5 – January 10, 2016
This installation represents my grandmother's experience of living at and having to leave Hiawatha, the Mississauga First Nation in central Ontario where she was born and raised. Principally I am attempting to illustrate her experience of having her identity as an Indigenous woman taken from her when in 1930 she married my grandfather a non-Native man of Welsh origin.
Very briefly, this meant that she was disenfranchised from her Indigenous heritage and her community. This was the same experience for many, many women across the country who were also subject to the patriarchal and assimilationist rules of this government act.
This installation marks the deeply troubling experience of my grandmother, her husband and children being formally requested to leave the Hiawatha Reserve. In the mid-1930s my grandmother and her young family had been allowed to return to the Reserve to care for my great-grandfather (Henry Cowie) during his ill-health. They lived there for almost five years despite the official policy of having no status and no rights – the family became part of the community with my mother and her siblings attending the on-reserve school. However, at the time of my great-grandfather's death in 1941 Laura and her family were compelled to leave the Reserve and relinquish any rights and property there within a very short time frame. This installation documents through family archival materials and found objects the things that she was able to take with her when she officially left the Reserve.
However, like most family stories there are extenuating circumstances – Laura never relinquished her identity as a Mississauga woman and she rejoiced when she regained her Status late in life. In addition, she never stayed away for very long as throughout her life she visited and kept up the friendships that had been established in her childhood.
The objects shown here are a representation of what she was able to take with her, there are also domestic objects that reflect the stories and memories that I have of her. Through these various objects, I am (I hope), demonstrating my grandmother's on-going sense of herself as a proud Mississauga woman and the fact that one's identity cannot be taken away.

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i10_May_2016_14:39:18_EDT
As part of Phase 3 of the
project, LB-2 is closed for renovations. The main staircase entrance to the Webster Library is closed until February 2017 as it is part of this phase of construction.
Visitors may enter the library via the temporary entrance on MacKay St. which provides stairs from street level to LB-3 or via the LB-1 elevator closest to the bookstore which goes directly to LB-3.
Signage has been posted on MacKay St. and on LB-1 indicating the temporary entrances.
Services that used to be on LB-2 (Circulation Desk, Reference Desk and the Course Reserves Room), as well as the book drop and newspapers display, are now on LB-3 in the MacKay St. / de Maisonneuve St. W. corner.
Phase 3 of the renovations is probably the largest of the 4 phases since it will encompass all of LB-2, including the entrance, the circulation and reference desks, and the main staircase. Work started on LB-2 Bishop St. side in March and on MacKay St. on May 10. The targeted date of completion is January 31, 2017.

But more important than statistics is the fact that many poems were beautifully crafted.  After much deliberation and discussion, our jury members selected the three winning submissions and another four that received an Honourable Mention.  .  The winning submissions will be posted on the wrap-around of the Library staircase, in the Vanier Library, in the Grey Nuns Reading Room and several other locations.

Text messaging service pilot project, Dec. 1-18 in Webster Library
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#guid=http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i27_Nov_2015_15:38:18_EST
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i27_Nov_2015_15:38:18_EST
The Libraries are piloting a text message service at Webster Library from December 1- December 18, 2015. The service will be offered Monday to Thursday, 1pm to 9pm, and Fridays, 1pm to 5pm. The primary goal of the service is to provide users who are being disrupted by other user's behaviours (ex: speaking in silent areas) with a method to communicate the disruption to Library staff. Just text your location and the problem to 514-245-2326.
The Libraries' study hall monitors will respond to each text message to inform the sender that they are on their way to help. Once they arrive, the monitors will ask the user causing the disruption to comply with the Library's Code of Conduct.
At the conclusion of the pilot period, the project will be evaluated. If it is deemed a success, a recommendation may be made to extend the project.

Exhibition: Tripping Hazard: Urban Clay 2015
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#guid=http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i16_Sep_2015_10:26:55_EDT
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i16_Sep_2015_10:26:55_EDT
Date: Sept 8 – Oct 17, 2015
In 2015 work from the Urban Clay (Ceramics 398b) course occupied all sorts of spaces at Concordia -  walls and pillars, in the middle of the floor, under escalators, throughout stairwells, on windows and in trees to name a few. These projects were temporary public artworks comprised of cast ceramic multiples. The works tend to play off of what already exists in the space and bring a new experience to the public.
Several students used this caution sign near their work, just in case the passerby did not notice it. It turns out that ‘tripping’ is a good metaphor for the way the public encounters Urban Clay projects, as they interrupt and disrupt what we are used to and jolt us into paying attention to the city we inhabit. ]]>

Welcome to the Libraries, from Guylaine Beaudry, University Librarian
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#guid=http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i04_Sep_2015_13:15:27_EDT
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i04_Sep_2015_13:15:27_EDT
Dear Concordia students,
It’s a great pleasure for me to welcome you to Concordia University and to its Libraries!
In an unprecedented effort to answer your longstanding requests for additional and quality study spaces, over the past month we’ve been working simultaneously on three major projects: They include the Webster Library Transformation, the Vanier Library renovations, and last but not least, the conversion of the former Grey Nuns Chapel and adjacent rooms into the magnificent Grey Nuns Reading Room and group study rooms.  The Vanier and Grey Nuns projects were recently delivered and the Webster Library Transformation will be completed by fall 2017.
The
is a four-phase project.  Once completed, the overall project will increase study space by 27 per cent and study seats by 114 per cent. What’s more, the plan includes 12 different types of study areas — ranging from dedicated space for graduate students to a zero-noise room and collaborative study spaces equipped with the latest learning technologies.  Phase 1 of the Webster Library Transformation (LB3 East and 2 classrooms on LB3 West) will be completed by the end of September 2015 and work has already begun on Phase 2 (LB5 East and West).
The Webster and Vanier libraries are open 24 hours/7 days-a-week and both libraries now have a self-service Course Reserve Room.  The self-service facility allows you to browse the collection by course, to peruse and copy the material you select and finally, to borrow the items you need by using the self-checkout station.  You also have access to
and self-serve
stations.
Discover your Libraries’ rich online world by visiting our .  It’s your gateway to world class research resources – over 500 databases of research literature covering .  Don’t hesitate to ask for help as you navigate through these resources. You can talk to a
by chat or email, and of course by telephone or in-person at one of our information desks.
We’re eager to hear from you. If you would like to share a suggestion or voice a concern, please visit our blog-style . We aim to be continually aware of and responsive to your research and study needs. In fact, many of the Libraries’ great services, such as the ability to
and tablets, Montreal’s first 24/7 , and the self-serve

Thank you for your engagement, your constructive contributions and to all of you, good luck with your 2015-16 academic year!
Guylaine Beaudry, Ph.D.University Librarian]]>

Vanier Library Exhibition: Comfort and Pleasure: English Porcelain Tea Cups c1900-1935
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#guid=http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i9_Jun_2015_9:08:47_EDT
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i9_Jun_2015_9:08:47_EDT
Tea is many things to many people. For some, it is a source of caffeine consumed for a quick boost, for many other it can be a source of comfort.  It is a ritual with very specific rules to follow; the temperature of the water; the blend of tea – in a bag vs. loose leaf; the construction of the teapot and shape of the cup. Every step is carefully prescribed and differs for each individual.  Do you add the milk before you pour or after? Or not at all? George Orwell had eleven steps for the perfect cup of tea and every step essential.1
This display of fine porcelain tea cups at the Vanier Library highlights the years 1900-1935 when new styles and shapes were influenced by the art trends of the time. In this display you will see many examples of the richly decorated imari style as well as some in the art deco and art nouveau styles.  Most of the cups in the display were manufactured in Staffordshire, England by T.C. Wild &Sons Ltd. later known by the brand "Royal Albert".
You can see all Orwell’s rules
or in the essay,  "A nice cup of tea" in The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell, Volume 3, 1943-45 located on the 3rd Floor of Webster Library:  PR 6029 R8A16 1968

RefWorks June 17, 2015 migration to U.S. based server

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i13_May_2015_13:59:41_EDT
Migration to a U.S. based server
Concordia Libraries’ RefWorks service, a voluntary service, will move from being hosted on a Canadian server to a U.S. based server as the Canadian service will be discontinued.
After the migration, your citations, files (if any), e-mail address and name will be stored on a U.S. server and subject to current and future legislation applicable in the U.S., including the USA PATRIOT Act, that allows U.S. authorities to access the personal information that you provide.
Technical changes
The migration will cause minor changes that include:
The URL (i.e. web address) of the login page will change, as will the URL of any shared accounts or folders.
Any RefWorks users who use the Write-n-Cite plug-in will need to download and install a new version. The plug-in will have a new name: ProQuest for Word.
Once the migration is complete, some users will receive an email that provides a new login name (which will be the email address used to create your account).
For more information about these changes, please see our information page, available at:
Time and date of the migration
The move is scheduled to occur on June 17, 2015 at 12 noon and will last approximately 5 hours. RefWorks will be unavailable during that time.
Opting out
If you would like to opt out of having your account and data migrated to the RefWorks U.S. server, we can help you to export your data and delete your account ahead of the migration.
To opt out, or if you have any questions, please contact me by email or telephone at
or 514 848-2424 extension 7726.

Webster Library, April 14th and 16th, 2015 from 11:30-1:30
Exam period can be stressful. And while there are a lot of ways to cope, is there anything more relaxing than the company of a furry, friendly animal?
On April 13th and 15th, the Vanier Library, on the Loyola Campus and on April 14th and 16th the Webster Library, on the Sir George Williams Campus will welcome several pet-therapy dogs from the Blue Ribbon Canine Centre. They’ll be on hand to help students de-stress and relax.
The visit will take place from 11:30-1:30 p.m. outside of Room VL-101 for Vanier and in the LB-201 area at Webster.
We welcomed the pet-therapy dogs last April and similar sessions have been used successfully at McGill University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the University of Wisconsin; and Yale University to help reduce anxiety and lift moods.

Meet Brandy the Shetland sheepdog
Among the canines on hand for the session will be Brandy, a Shetland sheepdog.
Along with her fellow pet-therapy dogs, Brandy will be waiting for you in the library. Brandy has met many people during her eight-year career, and is a proud founding member of Blue Ribbon Therapy Dogs.
As a performance dog who has participated in many dog-sport trials, she understands the pressure of exams.
She looks forward to her visit to Concordia, and hopes to brighten everyone's day.
All of the dogs have been vaccinated and will be on four-foot leashes.

Creating these letterforms helped students from DART331 [Words in Space] develop an awareness and understanding of the design of letterforms by observing and recording them in a context of public lettering and then creating a 3D model of 2 selected characters. Students engaged with the aesthetics and cultural contexts of the typography in its public environment and based their rendering on a typeface of their choice found from a source of public lettering.

The Concordia University Libraries invite you to attend “Memory and Commemoration: The Azrieli Holocaust Collection at Thirty,” a one day symposium in Montreal, Quebec, on Tuesday, March 10, 2015, marking the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of what is now one of the largest collections in North America of research materials on the Holocaust. The Collection was established in 1984 by Montreal businessman and philanthropist David Azrieli, CM, CQ (1922-2014), whose parents, brother, and sister died in the Holocaust. More information on the Collection is available here: .
The symposium begins at 2 p.m. in Room 767 of the Hall Building (7th floor, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd West) and will feature a panel of emerging and established Holocaust scholars from Concordia, Texas A&M, Michigan, and Graz, followed by a keynote by Debórah Dwork, the Rose Professor of Holocaust History at Clark University.

Linda Quartz, recipient of the 2014 Freda Otchere Staff Recognition Award
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#guid=http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i13_Feb_2015_13:49:39_EST
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i13_Feb_2015_13:49:39_EST
The
was established "to encourage and reward staff currently working for Concordia Libraries whose commitment and professionalism reflect the values exemplified by Freda Otchere".  The award, which carries with it a single lump sum payment of $650, is made possible through the generous gift of Dr. Dan Otchere, Associate Professor of Economics at Concordia University, who created the Freda Otchere Endowment Fund in 2010 in honour of his wife. From 1970 to 2004, Freda Otchere served the Concordia University Libraries as cataloguer and Head of Database Maintenance. Her exemplary service to the Concordia community is warmly remembered, and provides the model by which nominees are identified. The award is made annually by the University Librarian on the recommendation of the Staff Recognition Award Committee.
Linda Quartz is the recipient of the 2014 Freda Otchere Staff Recognition Award. Congratulations, Linda!
We would like to thank all of the people who made nominations and the members of the Staff Recognition Award Committee: Joseph Capano, Anna Michetti, Karen Mullett, David Thirlwall and Luigina Vileno. Here is a statement from the Chair of the committee, David Thirlwall, about this year’s award recipient:
Linda is “appreciated by her colleagues for her candor and compassion.” She is known for “creating a sense of community and belonging”. A prime example in 2014 is the leadership she showed in organizing a welcome for the Collections Services staff who moved into Vanier Library during the summer. This was a big change for the group, many of whom had been serving downtown for over 20 years. This example is one of many initiatives Linda took to organize memorable social events.
“This concern for staff well-being”, says one nominator, “also extends to students”. Linda was instrumental in planning and delivering the renowned
to address the stress that so many students are enduring. A nominator explained that “the idea had been discussed by several people before, but Linda was the one who finally made it happen”. She made herculean efforts in order to bring this idea to life. Her actions brought unprecedented attention to Vanier Library, including .
With these examples in mind, it is readily seen that Linda has made wonderful contributions to the University.  Her actions have brought support to the Concordia community, and have upheld the Concordia brand which promotes collegiality, respect, and attention to our students.
Linda made these exciting achievements over and above her usual exemplary work in the Vanier Library Media & Document Delivery unit. On a day to day basis, she presents “an example of equity, honesty and helpfulness in all of her interactions with students, co-workers and administrators”. “She volunteers to take on extra tasks”. She is “the person who helps move an idea from talk to action”.]]>

Also, the stairwell is enclosed so there should not be any problems due to dust created by the removal.

In the boxes, students from print media, ceramics, fibres, etc. have worked in collaboration to build on the tradition of games and match boxes. Incorporating personal, historical, and  mythological stories and concepts, these works intermingle images and/or texts that speak volumes.

Glen Adamson describes craft as a ‘cunning jester’ in the post disciplinary art world. He describes craft as cleverly poised to move fluidly through the boundaries that surround art and design, escaping the art world easier than art, going into the factory and coming out again into any kind of space. In the space of the city, students from the Urban Clay class at Concordia use ceramics to play the jester in shifting identity between art, design and even technology through temporary site-specific public art installations on the urban campus.

Vanier Library, November 25 and 27, from 11:00 to 2:00 p.m.
Exam period can be stressful. And while there are a lot of ways to cope, is there anything more relaxing than the company of a furry, friendly animal?
On November 25 and 27, the Vanier Library, on the Loyola Campus, will welcome several pet-therapy dogs from the Blue Ribbon Canine Centre. They’ll be on hand to help students de-stress and relax.
The visit will take place from 11:00 to 2:00 p.m. outside of Room VL-101.
We welcomed the pet-therapy dogs last April and similar sessions have been used successfully at McGill University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the University of Wisconsin; and Yale University to help reduce anxiety and lift moods.

Meet Brandy the Shetland sheepdog
Among the canines on hand for the session will be Brandy, a Shetland sheepdog.
Along with her fellow pet-therapy dogs, Brandy will be waiting for you in the library. Brandy has met many people during her eight-year career, and is a proud founding member of Blue Ribbon Therapy Dogs.
As a performance dog who has participated in many dog-sport trials, she understands the pressure of exams.
She looks forward to her visit to Concordia, and hopes to brighten everyone's day.
All of the dogs have been vaccinated and will be on four-foot leashes.

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i28_Oct_2014_17:21:07_EDT
in the Concordia University Libraries is marking its 30th anniversary in 2014-15 with a series of public events including an open house and a colloquium.
On Thursday, November 6 from 3pm to 7pm, members of the Concordia community and the public are invited to an open house at the Vanier Library (7141 Sherbrooke St W.). This event is being held as part of Holocaust Education Week. Recent acquisitions from the collection (approximately 60 items) will be on display, including rare acquisitions like anti-Semitic materials produced in Europe and North America before and after the Nazi’s came to power in 1933; reports by Allied governments and non-governmental groups describing growing violence against Jews in Germany and as well as the scope of Nazi atrocities, and post-war publications illustrating the scale and enormity of the Holocaust. Recently published secondary works will also be on display. Geoffrey Little, the collection's curator, will give a guided tour of materials at 4pm and 6pm. All are welcome.
On Tuesday, March 10 the Libraries will hold a colloquium on the theme of the Holocaust and Memory in the D.B. Clarke Theatre. Christopher Browning, emeritus professor of history at UNC Chapel Hill and a respected Holocaust scholar, is a confirmed speaker. More details will be announced shortly.
The Azrieli Holocaust Collection was established in 1984 with an endowment from Montreal businessman and philanthropist David Azrieli, CM, CQ (1922-2014), whose parents, brother, and sister died in the Holocaust. Today the collection is the largest and most specialized in Canada on the history of the Holocaust and Nazi Germany, the history of anti-Semitism, and the history of Jewish-Christian relations in the 19th and 20th centuries. It also documents the immeasurable impact of the Holocaust on post-Holocaust life, thought, and culture with special emphasis on Canada and the United States.
The collection contains approximately 8,500 titles from almost every discipline and includes rare books and ephemera from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s; digitized primary sources; microfilm collections of government records and war crimes trials; documentaries and feature films; survivor memoirs and diaries; and secondary texts. The Azrieli Holocaust Collection is an invaluable resource for Concordia students and faculty as well as for the broader community.

To mark the Collection’s thirtieth anniversary, which coincides with the seventieth anniversary of the liberation of the death camps and the end of the Second World War, Concordia University is organizing a one day colloquium in Montreal on 10 March 2015. Christopher R. Browning, the Frank Porter Graham Professor Emeritus Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is a confirmed speaker. We seek to gather scholars who have written about and studied the Holocaust from the vantage points of memory, commemoration, and culture. We also hope to publish selected contributions.
Proposals for papers, including those from emerging or junior scholars, are invited. We welcome proposals that address aspects of the creation of Holocaust memory through historical scholarship, museum exhibitions, memorials and monuments, literature, film, or popular culture. Proposals should be no more than 300 words and should include a CV. Materials should be sent in one file, preferably as a PDF, to Geoffrey Little (). The deadline for submissions is Tuesday, 18 November 2014. Applicants will be notified in December 2014. Funding may be available for presenters. ]]>

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i26_May_2014_11:15:52_EDT
Atrium 2nd floor, May 17 – July 4, 2014
Art as Books
This site-specific exhibition  tends to relate to the artistic process of creation and its own archive. Each of the four vitrines are divided in two different forms of artistic editions. One is sealed, untouchable because of the immobility in both the boxes they are in and the space where they are shown. The other is series of sketched edited books, intended to show the process for potential projects. These two bodies of work bridge together the notions of artistic legacy and the finality of a work of art. Are books the final result of an art work? Are sketches meant to be shown? What is art?

The commonplace book is a Renaissance invention, used to collect, compile, and classify passages, or facts encountered in books, or in nature. The gathering of material could be used for future arguments, speeches, or texts, with indexing easing the retrieval of material. (Professor Charles Gagnon)

Improved access to the library for Moodle users
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#guid=http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i18_Dec_2013_18:21:13_EST
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i18_Dec_2013_18:21:13_EST
A new Library Resources block now appears in Moodle. The goal of the block is to improve student access to library collections and services by promotion through Moodle, a starting point for many students engaged in coursework.
The Library Resources block automatically displays on the side of all Moodle course sites, adjacent to course content. Content within the block is generated dynamically, and is tailored to the specific Moodle course that the student has logged into. The Library Resources block provides convenient access to course textbooks, librarian recommended research databases and journals, the library catalogue, and more.
Here is an example of what the Library Resources block looks like:

The library is looking at installing technologies to support collaboration and will be testing equipment in the next few months.
As a trial project, we have set up Media:scape in the main corridor by the entrance to the library. Media:scape is furniture and technology integrated together with dual screens to allow you to share information from your tablets and laptops. It was generously lent to the library by a supplier for testing, so we encourage you to be gentle with it so that we may return it in good condition. Connectors to plug in Apple devices are available for lending at the Circulation Desk.

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i3_Oct_2013_12:07:26_EDT
Starting this week, Concordia University Libraries’ Interlibrary Loans Service (ILL) introduces electronic delivery of article requests. Thanks to an upgrade in the Colombo system, shared by all CREPUQ institutions, and changes to the Canadian Copyright Act, you will now receive articles and parts of works via your email, making this well used service more convenient and faster for you.
Some things to know about the new service:
You will receive an email that your article is ready for viewing. The email will contain an access link/URL which will lead to a webpage with a copyright statement. You will be asked to confirm that you have understood the legal uses of the material you requested before proceeding to it.
The article, or part of a work, will be available for downloading and printing via the access link/URL for 5 working days following viewing the document for the first time.
Please note that not all articles can be delivered electronically. In some cases, due to licensing or copyright restrictions, lending libraries may only allow for print copies to be delivered to requesters. In these cases articles will need to be picked up on campus as before.
The Interlibrary Loans
and
webpages now contain information about this service.

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i5_Sep_2013_16:51:34_EDT
Dear Concordia students,
Here we are at the start of an exciting new year. It’s a great pleasure for me to welcome you to Concordia University – and most particularly to the Libraries!
Be sure to visit your two libraries – the Vanier Library on the Loyola Campus and the Webster Library on the Downtown Campus. They’re yours to explore and enjoy. At both you’ll find a welcoming staff, great facilities, great collections, and a full suite of services.
Open 24 hours/7 days-a-week, your libraries are the premier place for study.  Orange study zones offer you spots where you can study quietly together with classmates and friends. Blue study zones provide a silent refuge for individual reading. Self-serve
facilities are always available.
You will soon discover your Libraries’ rich online world. Check out our
– or the . It’s your gateway to world class research resources – over 500 databases of research literature covering . Don’t hesitate to ask for help in navigating these resources. You can talk to a
by chat or email, and of course by telephone or in-person at the Information Desks.
We at the Libraries are eager to hear from you. If you want to air a concern or offer a suggestion, please try out our blog-style . We want to respond to your research and study needs. It is the suggestions and support of students that have brought about many of the Libraries’ great services – to name just a few: a service for
and tablets, Montreal’s first 24/7 , and self-serve
textbooks and readings!
I invite you to drop in to the Libraries' event on Tuesday October 22 in the LB Atrium, where you can learn about the , and how you the students are making Concordia University Libraries into a national leader in academic library service.
Finally, let me wish you all an enjoyable and successful 2013/2014 year of learning.
Yours truly,
Guylaine Beaudry, Ph.D.Interim University Librarian]]>

How would it respond to the threat of its own death? If the book came back to life and took on a psychological state of its own, what would that look like?
Curator:  Rachel Harris (Mabel Bee curatorial name)
Artists:
Bianca St Martin
Camille Cléant

Users who borrow a laptop from the Libraries should be aware that all files saved to the laptop will be automatically deleted when the computer is rebooted. So, please do not save your files to our laptops – instead, use a USB key, a cloud based site (e.g., Dropbox or Google Drive), or other option to save the file to an external location. Save frequently so that, in the unlikely event that there is a system crash, you don’t lose your work.
The Libraries made this change to protect the privacy of our users’ files on these shared computers. No files will be viewable by the next patron who borrows the laptop. The laptop will wipe all files on reboot.]]>

One for the Books presents the recent work of seven artists exploring the artists’ book in various forms.
These works invite a close examination into the intimate and reflexive space of the page, at the same time referencing other spaces: the private and domestic space, the ruminating mind, the past as it infiltrates the realm of the present, nature, the internet, the body and the space within and around it and even fictional, alternate worlds that uncannily resemble our own.

New: Unattended Workstation Procedure
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#guid=http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i18_Oct_2012_16:51:19_EDT
http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i18_Oct_2012_16:51:19_EDT
The Libraries’ public computer workstations are heavily used, especially during peak periods of the semester. For different reasons, some users leave public workstations unattended for a long period. This situation frustrates other users who are in need of workstations and prevents them from accessing library services and resources.
This procedure applies to computer workstations only, not study tables as they are too difficult to monitor.
The time limit on unattended computer workstations is 30 minutes.
When a student reports an unattended computer workstation, a staff member takes note of the workstation number and time.
30 minutes later, if the workstation is still left unattended, two staff members go back to the workstation and put personal belongings in a clear plastic bag and bring it to the Circulation Desk.
The following note is left at the workstation:
This workstation was left unattended on [DATE], from X:XX a.m./p.m. to X:XX a.m./p.m. Belongings were removed and can be picked up at the Circulation Desk.
Bags and notes are available at both information desks.
In order to claim items, a user needs to be able to describe what was removed.
Signage has been installed at workstations and in labs to inform users of this procedure.
This new procedure is also posted on the website under "".

Much of the work in this exhibition was made in response to the time students spent in Oaxaca Mexico as part of an exchange through the Oax-i-fornmia programme. Some works are reflections on craft and on making; some respond directly to place and history, and others are literally or figuratively offerings to a modern-day divine; but all express gratitude for the opportunity to travel, to converse, to observe, to learn, to dwell for a short time with the landscape and the people of the Oaxaca valley.

The City of Montreal is carrying out roadwork on De Maisonneuve Boulevard between Bishop and Mackay throughout the summer. This work is scheduled for completion on August 31.
As a result, visitors to the Webster Library may experience some noise, especially at the north end of the building. Those persons seeking quiet study areas are encourage to use the blue zones toward the south end of the library (away from De Maisonneuve).
Note also that, due to the construction, the Shuttle Bus stop is relocated to the northwest corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine.

http://library.concordia.ca/about/news/#i30_May_2012_17:44:23_EDT
Renovations are now underway in the vicinity of the circulation desk on the
200 level of the Webster Library due to flooding caused by severe thunderstorms
at the end of May. This may generate some noise from time to time. Those
individuals seeking quiet study space are advised to make use of the blue study
zones on the 300 or 400 level. Thanks to all our library users for their
patience while these urgent renovations are being made.
Although the Library suffered water damage during the storm, it has been
confirmed that the damage was confined to the library's Circulation Services
area. It appears that no collection materials, books or personal belongings
were affected.
The library has set up a temporary circulation desk located on the second
floor of the Webster Library, and services will be restored during the day.
Overdue loan charges will not be assessed for the period during which the
library was closed.
Previously posted hours are in effect at the Webster and Vanier Libraries.
Summer term hours: June 4 to August 10, 2012

Since 2002, the Research Forum (formerly the Library Poster Forum) has provided librarians, archivists, and information professionals with an opportunity to describe and promote their completed or in-progress research, to seek suggestions for enhancing their research interests, to identify potential new partners for projects, to test the effectiveness of their undertakings, and to promote research activities within the academic library community.
The Forum is also designed to showcase a diversity of research interests with a goal of highlighting the process of research. Accordingly, presentations or posters may reflect any stage or aspect of a librarian’s research including conceptualization, planning, data gathering, compilation, and findings. Faculty and graduate students from both of Montreal’s library schools are also invited. Presentations may be made in either English or French.
