Current Projects
While the idea of leisurely sitting down with a paper over coffee seems almost antiquated now, weekend papers (Saturdays in Canada, Sundays in the U.S.) were key to increasing and expanding readerships and essential in establishing the newspaper as a key participant in modernity and popular culture. In addition to mapping the changes to 26 newspapers in 13 cities across North America, The Sunday Paper explores the intersections between newspapers and other communications technologies. Examining the period between popularization (1890s) into the early part of the 20th century (to the 1920s), newspapers were shameless in their appropriation of other communication technologies, including (among others) magazines, film and radio. The bookis forthcoming from the University of Illinois Press.
This interest in how the newspaper changed in response to emergent media technologies has also extended to the contemporary moment in a project that explores how news stories translate into digital games. Designed to provide readers/players with a deeper contextual understanding of the social, political, economic and policy systems that often drive news stories but aren’t adequately explored in conventional news, newsgames provide an immersive experience for readers/players to better understand the systems at work in news stories. The Oldest Game, A Newsgame, explores sex work in Canada. Can games do journalism differently? How can game mechanics add complexity and nuance to journalistic storytelling? What are the relationships between long form journalism and digital games?
Another project, funded through a SSHRC grant (Micheline Cambron, PI), explores the launch of La Presse’s radio station in 1922. The project considers two cases: the launch of CKAC in Montreal by La Presse and CFCA in Toronto by the Toronto Star. The project explores why these two newspapers pursued radio and what differences marked their launch in the English- and French-language markets. The project will eventually expand to also include the launch of La Patrie’s CHLP in 1932.
