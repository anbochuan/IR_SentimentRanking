*Update* Wireless internet connection - iOS 11
Posted on November 2, 2017
Concordia staff and students using iOS 11 on their mobile device have reported limited connectivity over the past couple weeks when using the Concordia wireless network (ConcordiaUniversity and eduroam).
Concordia's IT administrators have investigated and suggest that users update their device to the newest release of iOS 11 and try connecting to the Concordia wireless network again.
If you try these steps and continue to experience limited connectivity, please report it to the Concordia Service Desk at
or ext. 7613.
