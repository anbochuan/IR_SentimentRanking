CUFA Report – 18 September 2008
September 18, 2008
This issue leads up to the open CUFA Council meeting on Monday Sept.22, by rehearsing first the interface of recent constitutional projects with our stalled contractual negotiations, by our president Charles Draimin from Accountancy, and Sociology and Anthropology’s Shelley Reuter. These reflections get their bite sharpened when JMSB’s Ian Rakita, one of our negotiators, proves just how deeply we have fallen behind colleagues in comparable universities. Computer Science’s Greg Butler, our Vice-President, situates these difficulties in budgetary surreality, lest budget be held out as a reason for not remedying them in our negotiations.
