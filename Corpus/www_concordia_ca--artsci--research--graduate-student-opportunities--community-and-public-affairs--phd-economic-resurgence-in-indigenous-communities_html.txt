INTERDISCIPLINARY PhDEconomic resurgence in Indigenous communities
About the research

This

The candidate will be working with an Indigenous community to map practices of economic resurgence that are anchored in land, in language, in tradition. Following Indigenous worldview(s), the candidate will work to build relationships of reciprocity as they co-develop and enact a flexible and reflexive methodology that will be based on principles of resistance, political integrity and privileging of Indigenous voice(s).
Financial commitment
Although academic autonomy is a given, the selected candidate is expected to conduct their fieldwork within the framework of the larger research project that is led by Professor Kruzynski. The candidate will be awarded a Research Assistantship to work with the research collective that is worth $14,500 (10 hours per week, following TRAC union rates) per academic year.  The selected candidate is also eligible for other opportunities, including Teaching Assistantships and entrance awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship ($32,400), Merit Scholarship ($10,000), and Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD - $35,949).
