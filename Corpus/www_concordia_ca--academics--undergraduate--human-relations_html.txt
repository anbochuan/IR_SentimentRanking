Why study Human Relations?
Train the leaders of the future. Help people fulfill their potential. When you study human relations, your passion for people shapes you into an agent for social change. Expertise in human relationships in the community and the workplace sets you on a path towards the helping professions. Whether you want to build strong teams in the corporate world or get organized at a grassroots level, our Human Relations program gives you the tools to become a next-generation leader.
In a curriculum that straddles the classroom and the outside community, you will hone your leadership and teamwork skills. You’ll also:
Study the dynamics of people in groups and one-on-one interactions
Practise techniques of intervention and facilitation that resolve conflicts
Learn to coordinate and execute special events and programs for the community-at-large
Perform in-the-field research
Concordia’s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for future graduate studies in such fields as human resource development and training, organization or community development, social work, and public or business administration. Students graduate with transferable skills that bring about empowerment, self-management and effective teamwork in a rapidly changing workplace.
