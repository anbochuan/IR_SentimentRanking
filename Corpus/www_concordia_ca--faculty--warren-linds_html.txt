Dr. Linds has been a full-time faculty member at Concordia
since August, 2004.Before beginning his graduate studies at the University of
British Columbia in 1996, he spent 17 years working in international
development education. Dr. Linds also worked for 6 years in community
television, radio and newspapers in Vancouver and Newfoundland. He has had
extensive experience in popular theatre and community development. This
background has been critical to his teaching approach where he brings practical
experiences and theoretical approaches together. Dr. Linds has published in the
areas of group facilitation, anti-oppression and anti-racism pedagogy, the
fostering of youth leadership, and alternative and arts-based approaches to
qualitative research and documentation. He has presented at both national and
international conferences in education, critical pedagogy, popular theatre and
complexity theory.
