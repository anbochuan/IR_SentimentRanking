Areas of research and teaching
My main focus is game studies, with particular interests in players and the culture of gameplay. I’m currently working on a book about Japan’s role in the creation of the game industry as well as game culture generally. I’m also doing work on social games, sports videogames, and the now defunct casual MMO Faunasphere.
