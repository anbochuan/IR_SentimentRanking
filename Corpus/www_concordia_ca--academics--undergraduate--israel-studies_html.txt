Offered by:

Why choose Israel Studies?
The Minor in Israel Studies, the first and only undergraduate program of its kind in Canada, is designed to allow students to complement their core area of study with courses in history, political science, religion, literature and language. The study of modern Israel is a significant focus of the program, but students will also explore this birthplace of major civilizational currents in all its facets and time periods. Students will gain proficiency in either Hebrew or Arabic: students with prior Hebrew proficiency will enrol in Arabic language classes and students with Arabic proficiency will take Hebrew. Students of the program may take advantage of the option for intensive study in Israel.
Program details
The Minor in Israel Studies is a 24-credit program intended for undergraduate students in the Faculty of Arts and Science who wish to complement their core area of study with a selection of courses on Israel.
The Minor covers courses in the following areas:
Languages (3 to 9 credits)
Politics and religion in Israel (3 credits)
Israel and the Middle East (3 credits)
The remaining 9 to 15 credits for the Minor program may be drawn from a broad selection of Israel-themed courses, offered in collaborations with departments including Art History, Classics, Modern Languages and Linguistics, English, History, Religion, and Political Science.  While not all departments are represented each semester, new courses are introduced every year, constantly widening the reach of the program and the diversity of its offerings.
3 credits chosen from any courses dealing primarily with Israel and approved by the Director of the Azrieli Institute of Israel Studies.
