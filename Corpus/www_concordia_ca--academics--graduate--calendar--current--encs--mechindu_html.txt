Master of/Magisteriate in Engineering (Aerospace)
Admission Requirements. Applicants must hold a Bachelor’s degree in engineering or equivalent with high standing. For further details, refer to the section  for Master of/Magisteriate in Engineering in the appropriate pages of the graduate calendar.
Requirements for the Degree
Students must complete a minimum of 45 credits of academic work consisting of: 36 credits of course work in the 6000 or 7000 level (2 courses must be taken outside Concordia), Aerospace Case Study (minimum 3 credits) and an Industrial Stage (6 credits). The selection of courses must be approved by the program director. For course prerequisites, refer to the course descriptions.
Note: Some graduate courses are content equivalent with specified undergraduate courses. These courses are not available for credit to students who have completed the undergraduate equivalent. Refer to the course description where such courses are marked with an (*).
General/Preparatory Core Courses. Normally, 12 credits are required to be completed from the list provided below. Any request for change on this requirement must be approved by the program director. Depending on the background, it may be required for the student to complete certain specified preparatory courses as part of their program.
ENCS 6021, 6141; INDU 6131, 6211, 6241, 6351; ENGR 6131, 6201, 6421, 6441, 6461, 6501, 7181; MECH 6451, 6481, 6941.
Specialization Courses. 24 credits are to be completed from the specialization courses in one or more of the areas listed below. For other courses available from the participating universities, consult their listings.
Students should consult the program director at their home university for the selection of courses to suit their area of specialization and need not confine their choice to any one area. A minimum of two courses are to be taken outside of Concordia (minimum 3 credits per course), at least one each from any two of the participating universities. Courses must be chosen from the equivalent Master of Aerospace Engineering program of the participating universities. For courses available from the participating universities, consult their listings and request permission for limited enrolment courses. A second Aerospace Case Study course may be considered as a specialization course.
Aeronautics and Propulsion.ENGR 6251, 6261; MECH 6081, 6111, 6121, 6161, 6171, 6191, 6231, 6241.

Structures and Materials.
ENGR 6311, 6511, 6531, 6541, 7331; MECH 6301, 6321, 6441, 6471, 6481, 6521, 6561, 6581, 7501.
Space Engineering.
ENGR 6951, 7201; MECH 6251.
Aerospace Case Study. A minimum of three credits (up to a maximum of six credits) must be obtained from the Aerospace Case Study courses. These courses, organized by CIMGAS, are conducted by experts from industry, and are given at one of the participating universities. The material given in a particular case study course might be offered only once. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the student to choose an appropriate course when it is offered. Space in some case study courses may be limited. These courses are:
MECH 6961 Aerospace Case Study I (3 credits)
MECH 6971 Aerospace Case Study II (3 credits)
ENGR 7961 Industrial Stage and Training (6 credits)
Prerequisite: Completion of at least twelve credits in the composite option and at least twenty-one credits in the aerospace program or permission of program director.
This is an integral component of the aerospace program in the Mechanical Engineering program that is to be completed under the supervision of an experienced engineer in the facilities of a participating company (Canadian work permit is required). The topic is to be decided by a mutual agreement between the student, the participating company and the program director. The course is graded on the basis of the student’s performance during the work period, which includes a technical report.
There may be some restrictions placed on students chosen for the industry sponsored “stage”. For those students who are unable to obtain an industrial stage, it is possible to take ENGR 7961 for a project carried out at the university. Such students must obtain the approval of the program director.
Career Prospects. In Montreal, graduates have found work in companies such as Pratt & Whitney Canada, Bell Helicopter, CAE Electronics, Bombardier Aerospace, and others. They hold positions as varied as consulting engineers, aircraft designers, manufacturing plant managers, vice presidents, and chief executive officers. Some have also gone on to form their own companies, while others have taken jobs across Canada and abroad. A number of our graduates hold teaching positions in several universities across North America and in other countries.
Graduate Certificate in Mechanical Engineering
Admission Requirements. Applicants to the program must hold a bachelor’s degree in engineering with above-average standing. The Faculty Graduate Studies Committee will determine the acceptability of an applicant for admission to the program and may require the applicant to do specific remedial course work to meet the program requirements.
Requirements for Completion
The Graduate Certificate program can be completed in one year. Students with high standing in their Bachelor’s program and whose academic records satisfy the requirements for Good Standing in the Master’s program in Mechanical Engineering (see
section) may apply for transfer to the Master’s program.
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete a minimum of 16 credits in one of the fields of concentration listed below.
