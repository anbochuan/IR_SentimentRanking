Concordia University Foundation
Concordia University Foundation
The Concordia University Foundation, incorporated in 1991 and operational as of 1996, exists for one purpose: to be the best possible fund management partner for Concordia University. Our partnership flourishes through the generosity of alumni, friends, corporations, foundations and, especially, volunteers and staff members. Our combined efforts help create and foster an environment in which teaching, learning and research positively affect the quality of life in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the rest of the world.
The Foundation plays an important role in ensuring the long-term viability of Concordia’s numerous programs and initiatives. This is accomplished through the ongoing development of the Foundation’s financial resources. While some gifts are used for short-term needs, the investment of gift proceeds for long-term and endowed purposes is essential.
Total assets under management include both designated and endowed capital. The largest component of invested assets is the Foundation’s long-term investment pool, which is managed in accordance with the Portfolio Investment Policy established by the Investment Committee.
