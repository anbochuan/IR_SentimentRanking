Milan Forum for Action on Preventing Violent Extremism and Mass Atrocities
November 27, 2017 – November 28, 2017 (all day)
The Milan Forum is a global initiative to counter violent extremism by working with lawmakers from all regions of the world and to create global democratic consensus in preventing violent extremism and mass atrocities.
The goal of the initiative is to mobilize legislators to adopt effective policies to defeat the ideology of violent extremists through strategies that can bring about their isolation while promoting human rights, inclusion, democracy and good governance, the Rule of Law, gender equality and healthy civil societies.
The Forum will be characterized by the congregation of 100-200 parliamentarians in representation of the Global Parliamentarians for Global Action network from 142 countries in Milan, Italy, on November 27-28, 2017. It will feature discussions that will focus on different subject areas, including justice, gender-equality, civil society and the rehabilitation of children.
The Milan Forum will include presentations by legislators; academics; civil society and UN experts, including Ms. Virginia Gamba, Under-Secretary-General & Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, and Mr. Ivan Simonovic, Assistant-Secretary-General & Special Advisor to the UN Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect.
