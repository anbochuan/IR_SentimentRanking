Program: MSc
The principal objective of the seminar will be to evaluate current empirical and theoretical issues in consumer research, with special emphasis on journal articles with interdisciplinary content. Methodological and review articles will also be discussed. The focus on the seminar is the subset of human behaviour related to the consumption and/or use of goods and services, as well as the processes that lead up to them. Major emphasis will be placed on marketing communication, attitude development and attitude change, information processing, decision-making processes and strategies, as well as the post-purchase process including new findings in the areas of consumer satisfaction and cognitive dissonance.

One of the most pervasive actions that humans engage in is making decisions. Individuals choose which products to purchase, universities to attend, careers to pursue, mates to marry, among countless other decisions that they will make in their lifetimes. How does a consumer decide which product to purchase? How much information will an executive use prior to deciding whether to launch or abort a new product? What are the attributes that men and women look for in their ideal mates? How do individuals allocate their gift giving expenditures to the various recipients? The purpose of this course will be to introduce the student to two areas of inquiry that can help us understanding how individuals make decisions. The first part of the course will focus on the vast behavioral literature in judgment and decision making in an attempt to better understand how individuals arrive at a final judgment and/or choice. The second part of the course will shift focus to a recently developed Darwinian framework namely evolutionary psychology, to show that many behaviors, cognitions, emotions, preferences, and choices that we make are steeped in our Darwinian heritage.

Segmentation and positioning are two of the most critical strategic choices in marketing. This course focuses on some statistical models that are used often by researchers in segmentation and positioning. Collectively, these tools aim to (1) understand the nature of consumer perceptions and preferences and (2) examine if they are homogeneous across groups of buyers. The models to be covered include factor analysis, deterministic and probabilistic multidimensional scaling, correspondence analysis, internal and external analysis of preferences, conjoint analysis and various types of cluster analysis. In addition to providing an understanding of the statistical foundations of these popular models in marketing research, the course will expose the students to "hands-on" data analysis through assignments that require the use of statistical software such as BMDP, SPSS, SAS, and other software shared by researchers and academicians.
