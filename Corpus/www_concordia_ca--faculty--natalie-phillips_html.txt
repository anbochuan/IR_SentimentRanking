Research
Overview: My general area of research is cognitive aging and adult human neuropsychology, with an emphasis on integrating behavioural and electrophysiological (event-related brain potentials, ERP) measures of brain function in aging and neurological populations. Current research areas include: 1) identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (who are at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease) by studying neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and anatomical measures of language and executive function; 2) studying interactions between working memory and language function; 3) audio-visual speech perception in younger and older adults and patients with dementia; and 4) bilingual language processing. (Funding by NSERC, CIHR, Alzheimer Society of Canada).
