As an independent documentary maker, trans-media artist, and professor who lived in Central and South America for over six years, I am committed to producing work that connects individuals across cultures. Over fifteen years of community media experience and a background in political economics, electronic media art, and Latin American studies, fuel my exploration of new media as art and as an educational tool.I am interested in new approaches to community collaborations and the documentary format and my work connects personal stories to larger social concerns. My new project, The Shore Line, is in interactive documentary looking at the tensions between unchecked development and climate change on coastal towns and cities around the world.

Going Public responds to the urgent need to expand current thinking on what it means to co-create and to actively involve the public in research activities.
