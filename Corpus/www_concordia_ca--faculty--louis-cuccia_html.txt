Chiral crystals, Mirror symmetry breaking, Chiral amplification and Supramolecular chemistry.
Teaching
I am currently teaching Introductory Organic Chemistry I (Chem-221) and Advanced Organic Chemistry IV - Structure & Stereochemistry (Chem-325). I will also initiate a course entitled Supramolecular Materials which will focus on the hierarchical structures found in Biology and how they serve as inspiration for new materials and technology. This course based on current literature, would be oriented towards the areas in which biology is being used as a guide for developing new materials (Supramolecular Chemistry, polymer science, biomimetic and bioinspired materials, and nanomechanics of materials and biomaterials).
