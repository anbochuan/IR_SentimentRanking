Research activities
Our research focuses on theoretical studies of chemical reaction dynamics in various phases of nature. With the recent advances in femtosecond spectroscopy, which now permit the observation of chemical reactions in real time, there is an ever increasing interest in such theoretical studies, as they can predict, explain and guide experiments. In particular, molecular dynamics simulations allow one to simulate the motion of atoms and molecules at the microscopic level as chemical reactions occur, providing invaluable information about their molecular mechanisms and kinetics. Dynamical studies are essential since they provide a link between potential energy surfaces determined by electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements of the chemical dynamics and thermodynamics. Because chemical reactions occur in various phases of nature, our research involves reactive systems in the gas phase, condensed phases, and clusters, which are considered to be novel intermediate states of matter. Clusters can be used as tools for selective microsolvation, or they can be a distinct class of materials with unique properties.
Our computer simulations typically involve high-performance scientific computing on state-of-the art workstations and supercomputers, and we make use of a wide arsenal of computational tools which take their roots in quantum chemistry, classical and quantum mechanics, and statistical thermodynamics. Extensive use is made of semiempirical, approximate and ab initio electronic structure theory, both in the gas-phase and in solution, molecular modeling, molecular dynamics and pioneering first-principles simulation techniques. We are particularly interested in studying solvation effects and dynamics in liquids and small clusters, organic and biologically relevant reactions, photochemical processes, metal and semiconductor cluster fragmentation, environmentally and technologically relevant chemical reactions, cluster and materials science in general. We maintain an intensive collaboration with renown experimentalists worldwide, as connection with experiment is crucial for assessing the reliability of our computer simulations and theoretical models, which, in turn can be used to improve our fundamental understanding of chemistry.
