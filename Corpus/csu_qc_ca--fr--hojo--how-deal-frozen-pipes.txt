Are you without water due to frozen pipes?!
Are you worried your water pipes might burst?!
There are certain recourses you can take:
- Let your landlord know!
- Try and figure out where the pipes are freezing. Do they run underground or outside? Are both hot and cold pipes frozen?
-It is your landlords’ responsibility to ensure that you can enjoy the full extent of your dwelling. Which means you should have hot water! Not fulfilling this responsibility has repercussions. The tenant could request compensation due to lack of prolonged hot water in the dwelling.
- It is your landlords’ responsibility to ensure your pipes do not freeze as they could burst which would result in major work. According to the Régie du Logement “major work includes important repairs or improvements in a dwelling such as (…) replacing the plumbing or the heating system “.
-Voicemails going unanswered? Having trouble being taken seriously? Write your landlord an official demand letter stating your concerns about the frozen pipes as well as mandating the landlord to fix this problem whether through the Régie du Logements’ Major Work process or through their Urgent and Necessary Repairs process, depending on the urgency of your situation (i.e. if the pipes or frozen or if the pipes have burst).
