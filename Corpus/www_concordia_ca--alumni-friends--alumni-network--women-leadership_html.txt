Women and Leadership
Empowering women graduates to connect, share professional experiences and expertise and learn from each other
Tap into a worldwide network of successful alumnae
Concordia has more than 91,700 women graduates around the world.
They're a diverse group, working across many fields of employment — business, media, engineering, arts, science, humanities and more. Many are leaders in their field, each with her own networks and experiences to share.
The Concordia Alumni Women and Leadership program connects our alumnae, both in person and online, facilitating the exchange of ideas, information and experiences — to inspire and learn from each other.
