Why study Journalism?
Prepare for the future of news. You’ll become a first-rate journalist, and a future decision-maker, capable of thinking critically and leading journalism in new directions. In our program, you can learn a range of current production skills, cover the same events as working journalists, do internships that give you valuable newsroom experience, and graduate functionally bilingual.
Your professional training balances practical skills with theory and analysis. Our production workshops apply newsroom standards to every assignment, and our seminars focus on the social, economic, political and ideological contexts in which journalism is practised.
You’ll benefit from small class sizes and state-of-the-art facilities that replicate modern newsrooms. We equip you with the storytelling tools you need to work in journalism and to adapt to this ever-changing profession.
You’ll graduate a skilled journalist, able to think critically about your profession and our society.
