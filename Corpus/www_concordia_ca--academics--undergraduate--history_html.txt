Why study History?
History shapes the world we inhabit; it substantially determines the constraints and the possibilities of our experience; it colours the aspirations and aversions that drive us, individually and collectively. We can choose to live in ignorance of history, but we cannot live independently of it. History, in other words, is a burden we all share, but for some of us it is also a resource. It imposes limits but also supplies opportunities.
History is more than mere facts; it is a dynamic discipline built on analysis, debate and interpretation. When you study history, you develop a cultural vocabulary that examines humanity through events, culture and context. Our modern multimedia facilities bring history to life through images, texts, and sound recordings. Our faculty specialize in areas that reflect the world’s diversity. Whether your heart lies in modern Africa, medieval England or contemporary Japan, you will have the opportunity to study the historical periods and geographical locations that capture your attention. Complement your studies with thematic courses such as film in history, gender, the history of peace and war or environmental history.
