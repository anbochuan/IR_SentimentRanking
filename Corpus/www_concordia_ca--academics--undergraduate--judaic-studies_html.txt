Why choose Judaic Studies?
Immerse yourself in the history, culture and literature of Jews and deepen your understanding of the lived experience of the Jewish community through time and today.  Touching on ancient and modern languages, politics, philosophy, and law, compare Jewish and other religious traditions, explore contemporary scenes and assess how mysticism, rituals and philosophy intersect with popular culture, sexuality, feminism, food, ethics and worship.
As you look at all facets of Jewish experience, including the lives of women in all periods (the Talmud, medieval, modern) and the Holocaust, you’ll think deeply about what it means to be Jewish and to be an ethnic minority. You’ll also have the chance to build your knowledge of Hebrew.
Thanks to a growing emphasis on field work in Montreal, you’ll get to interact with members of various Jewish sects and Jews who’ve moved toward becoming non-religious.
You’ll also have the opportunity to take advantage of funding to study in Israel through the Azrieli Institute.
