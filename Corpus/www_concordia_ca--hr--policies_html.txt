Policies
Policies
Policies and guidelines are an important part of our culture and our working life at Concordia. They have been created to provide structure and clarity to assist employees in navigating through unclear situations and provide guidance and support to assure positive conclusions.
Awareness and comprehension of Concordia policies benefit both employees and the university, as they provide procedures and measures to ensure clear expectations and outcomes.
Concordia policies are being underscored again in 2013 because they’re an important part of everyday life at Concordia. They’re there to make sure Concordians know their rights, and those of the other members of the community. They also outline the steps for resolution and the potential resources available should those rights be violated.
The campaign will run from October 22 to November 13. Weekly stories about policies are posted on , the Concordia intranet, and promoted in the weekly e-newsletter. These stories included links to the specific policy.

September 11, 2012
To support our employees in better understanding our policies, we launched a policy awareness campaign in fall 2012.
From September 12 to October 26, 2012, weekly policy stories were posted in the news section of Concordia.ca and promoted in the weekly e-newsletter. These stories included links to the specific policy.
Managers were also asked to read seven additional policies that were identified in weekly reminder emails. After the seven-week period, there was a pop-up box when employees logged into the MyConcordia portal, requesting confirmation that the policies had been read. Once confirmed, full access to the portal was granted.
FAQ
I have worked at the university for 25 years, why do I have to confirm reading the university policies now?
Concordia employees have always been expected to familiarize themselves with the policies that are relevant to them. It is important for all employees to understand the content of the policies to assist them in making the best decisions, particularly in unclear or ambiguous situations. Confirmation that every employee has become familiar with the policies that are most relevant to them is simply a process by which to ensure that everyone has read and understands the policies significant to them.
I am a manager with staff, why do I have to read seven additional policies?
The additional policies were selected for their relevance to managers. There are policies where a manager’s leadership is important for the safety of employees, such as the policy related to emergency situations.
Additionally, there are policies related to travel, expenses and procurement that are more relevant to managers than to staff.
I am a manager with no staff, how many policies do I need to read?
You are expected to read the same seven policies that all employees are required to read and any others that would be related to the type of work you do.
Does everyone working at the university have to confirm having read the assigned policies?
Yes, all employees, current and new are required to confirm that they have read the selected policies on an annual basis.
Who do I contact if I do not understand a policy?
Employees may speak with their managers or contact the originating office of the policy, which is identified on each policy.
