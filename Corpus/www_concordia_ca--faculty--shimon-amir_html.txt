Overview: Circadian rhythms are daily oscillations in behavior, physiology and gene expression that help organisms adapt to recurring challenges and opportunities in their physical and social environment. In mammals, these rhythms are governed by a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and by subordinate clocks located elsewhere the brain and periphery. At a molecular level, the generation of circadian rhythms is based on autoregulatory transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational feedback loops driven by protein products of a small set of clock genes.
Members of my laboratory employ different animal models to study the nature, regulation, and function of circadian clocks in regions of the forebrain important in stress, motivation, and emotion.  Using molecular, anatomical, pharmacological, electrophysiological, and behavioral methods we study how the rhythms of expression of core clock genes and proteins within functionally-defined forebrain structures are synchronized; how these rhythms are affected by inputs from different regions of the brain; how they respond to environmental, behavioral, pharmacological, hormonal, and metabolic perturbations that disrupt homeostasis (e.g., changes in the external light cycle, stress, dopaminergic manipulations, treatment with drugs of abuse, glucocorticoids, restricted feeding); and, finally, how genetic and viral disruption of clock gene expression within specific brain regions influence behavior. In a second line of research we study modes and mechanisms of plasticity within the master SCN clock focusing on the role of translation control mechanisms (eIF4E, 4E-BP) and of conditioning/associative learning.
