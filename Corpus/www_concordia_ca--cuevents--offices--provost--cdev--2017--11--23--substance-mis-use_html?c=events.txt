Substance (Mis) Use

Are you concerned about your relationship with Drugs and/or Alcohol?
Have you tried to stop using on your own but were unsuccessful?
Have you experienced a blackout?
If you responded yes to any of the above, come join our group. During these 4-weeks we will examine a variety of aspects regarding drug and alcohol addiction.  Together we will look at the various stages of addiction and recovery, provide psycho-educational materials, examine a variety of coping strategies, provide a comfortable atmosphere and reduce the stigma associated with substance use/abuse.
