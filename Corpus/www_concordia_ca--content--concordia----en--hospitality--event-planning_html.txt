Event planning
Great events start here
Concordia’s two campuses offer an array of venues in the heart of Montreal and on the west-end of the city.  Whether planning your event or working with an event coordinator, we walk you through all the information and resources needed from set up to clean up, and all the details in between, to help make your event a success.
