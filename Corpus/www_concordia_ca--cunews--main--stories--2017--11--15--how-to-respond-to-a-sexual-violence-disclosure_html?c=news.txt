How to respond to a sexual violence disclosure
Concordia’s Sexual Assault Resource Centre provides a guide for supporting survivors
Posted on November 15, 2017
Jennifer Drummond, SARC coordinator: “Let the survivor take back control by respecting their choices.”
When someone tells you about their experience with sexual violence, your response means a lot.
There are many reasons why someone may disclose to you. You may be a trusted friend or mentor and they need support and a listening ear.
Someone could also disclose to a professor or teaching assistant because they are suffering from psychological or physical consequences of assault and are not able to meet their academic deadlines, study for exams or attend classes.
Jennifer Drummond is coordinator of the
(SARC) at Concordia. She says the most important thing you can do is listen without judgment and be present for the person.
“One of the biggest barriers to someone disclosing is that they are afraid of not being believed or of being blamed. So, when a survivor does disclose sexual violence, it is imperative that the response is, ‘I believe you. It’s not your fault.’”
Drummond also suggests the following:

Explain that what they tell you is confidential.
Provide information about resources such as the .
Offer to accompany them to access resources.
Respect their decision about the next steps.
Someone’s reaction to experiencing sexual violence is complicated, as it could involve mutual friends or a respected authority figure.
“When hearing about a person’s experience of sexual violence, it is normal to want to take action or give advice,” Drummond says. However, she encourages a response that puts the survivor in charge.
“It is important for the survivor to have control over next steps, and this means respecting their choices.”
