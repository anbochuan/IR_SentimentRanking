Why choose the Certificate in Arts and Science?
If you want to explore different fields of study, prefer to follow a shorter program, or earn university credits outside a traditional degree, the Certificate in Arts and Science gives you that flexibility. The certificate may also be of interest to those who already have an undergraduate degree, but are looking to refresh their knowledge or learn new skills.
Students in this program may take courses from up to three different departments in the Faculty, and may apply any earned credits towards a Bachelor of Arts or Science.
