In addition to being the most important source of organized trips for Concordia Students, the CSSC has created its own community within Concordia; allowing students with the like passions of skiing and snowboarding to come together and socialize at our movie premieres and many themed parties throughout the year. Throughout the season, the CSSC has around a dozen scheduled trips to the best mountains in the east, two of which are our well known overnight trips. Moreover, with the help of its executives, the CSSC offers the "Learn to Ski and Ride Day", which allows individuals who have never stepped onto skis or a snowboard to learn the basics which will become the foundation for future learning.
We also contribute to student life off the slopes with our notoriously hectic annual "Halloween Howler" and a number of newer initiatives such as our ski and snowboard movie screenings and our B&B Socials.
We do most of our club contact on Facebook or in the office so check out:  or swing up our office anytime you have any questions. Office hours will be posted on our Facebook group and website: .
