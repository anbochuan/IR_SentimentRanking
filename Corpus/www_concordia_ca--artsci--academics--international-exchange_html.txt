Transfer students
Transfer students are accepted to the university based on their previous academic history. Students transferring from accredited institutions will receive transfer credits, when possible, that will count toward the degree. Specific course transfer may be possible if they are required for the program of study. Transfer credit determination, however, is only evaluated after an admission application has been submitted to the university. Specification of transfer credits may require a department assessment after an offer of admission has been given.
Residency requirement rules require that a minimum of 45 credits, these normally being the last 45 credits, and at least 50% of your program be completed at Concordia University. The four year (120 credits) Early Childhood and Elementary Education (ECEE) and the Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL) program require that a student completes at least 60 credits at Concordia University.
