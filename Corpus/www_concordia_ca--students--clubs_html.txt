Student groups
Are you looking to explore your interests, gain skills or meet new people?
Get started:
Check out the many student groups you can get involved with at Concordia. The rich collection of student groups include cultural, religious, social and academic groups.
Already have a group?
Find and book space on campus or with the Dean of students. Get planning tips, and learn about guidelines for food, alcohol and postering on the campus.
In order to obtain funding from the University and umbrella associations, student groups must register with the Dean of Students Office. Groups must re-register each year starting June 1.
