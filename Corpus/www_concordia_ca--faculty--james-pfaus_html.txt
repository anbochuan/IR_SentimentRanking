Research
Sexual behavior, animal, human, neuropharmacology, neuroendocrinology
Overview: My research is generally concerned with the neurochemical and molecular events that subserve sexual behavior and neuroendocrine functions. I am interested in the role of brain monoamine and neuropeptide systems in sexual arousal, desire, reward, and inhibition in laboratory animals. I am also interested in the inhibitory and disinhibitory effects of drugs of abuse on sexual behavior. Current research examines the role played by steroid hormones, neurotransmitter systems, and cell signalling mechanisms, in the neuronal and behavioral responses to primary and conditioned sexual stimuli, especially those that induce sexual partner preferences. The neurochemical and molecular systems activated by primary and conditioned sexual stimuli are being explored using a combination of in vivo techniques such as microdialysis, and ex vivo techniques such as immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and autoradiography.
My research in human sexual function focuses on subjective and objective measures of sexual desire and pleasure in women and men, and how such measures are altered by different types of erotic stimulation. We are also exploring the sexual functioning of individuals under stress or with anxiety disorders.
Funding
My research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). I have also held consulting grants from several pharmaceutical and biotech companies, for example, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Lundbeck, Palatin, and Emotional Brain, to examine potential sexual side-effects of different psychiatric medications and for work on the identification of new pharmacological tools to treat male and female sexual dysfunctions.

Biography
Jim Pfaus received his Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of British Columbia in 1990 under the direction of Drs. Anthony G. Phillips and H. Christian Fibiger. Following postdoctoral training in molecular biology and behavior with Dr. Donald Pfaff at the Rockefeller University (1990-1992), he joined the Department of Psychology and the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia University where he is a full professor. Jim was the 1995 recipient of the Frank A. Beach Award from the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, and in 1997 was inducted into the International Academy of Sex Research. He received the Frank A. Beach Comparative Psychology Award from the American Psychological Association in 2009, the Sandra Lieblum Lectureship from the International Society for Sexual Medicine in 2011, the Herbert Thomas Award from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2012, the Concordia University Research Award in 2013, and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality in 2014. He was made a fellow (IF) of the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and a Concordia Research Fellow, both in 2013.  Jim is the current President of the International Academy of Sex Research (IASR), serves on the Standards Committee of the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM), and on the Board of Directors of ISSWSH. Jim is an associate editor of the Journal of Sexual Medicine and Sexual Medicine Reviews, section editor for preclinical research and psychophysiology for Current Sexual Health Reports, and serves on the editorial boards of the Behavioral Neuroscience, Hormones and Behavior, Investigative and Clinical Urology, and Physiology and Behavior. He is also an associate editor of the APA Handbook of Psychology and Sexuality. At Concordia, Jim serves as Chair of the Human Research Ethics Committee, Vice-Chair of the Animal Research Ethics Committee, and is a Fellow of Concordia’s Science College.  He is cross-appointed in the graduate programs of Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Exercise Science.
Fun fact
Jim’s son Josh (age 13) is an amazing violin and hockey player.
