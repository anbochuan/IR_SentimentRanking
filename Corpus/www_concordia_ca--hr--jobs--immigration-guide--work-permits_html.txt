Work permits
Work permits
Individuals who are neither Canadian citizens nor Canadian permanent residents must obtain a work permit to be allowed to work in Canada. Individuals must meet the requirements for the work permit and must meet the general requirements for entering Canada. The work permit should be valid for the full period of employment and must identify Concordia University as the Employer. If there are multiple employers, Concordia University must still be clearly indicated on the document. Alternatively, holders of “open” work permits (where no employer is specified) may work at Concordia.
We cannot pay anyone who is not legally entitled to work at Concordia. This applies to full- and part-time professors, visiting scholars, research professors and post-doctoral fellows. Individuals holding work permits listing other universities/employers and who wish to teach at Concordia must submit an application to Citizenship and Immigration Canada to amend the work permit so Concordia University is indicated as an additional employer.
Concordia University graduate students enrolled in full-time studies with a valid study permit may work on campus and may hold any number of jobs on campus.  They may work off campus for up to 20 hours a week during regular academic sessions and full-time during scheduled breaks such as the winter and summer holidays or spring break; a valid study permit is acceptable in lieu of a work permit.  If the student does not maintain full-time enrolment status or satisfactory academic results, he/she is no longer authorized to work on or off campus.
Getting a work permit for employment in Québec is typically a three-step process for individuals who do not fall under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA):
Concordia University must acquire a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Service Canada
Concordia University must apply to Québec Immigration for a Certificat d'acceptation du Québec (CAQ)
The individual applies for the work permit at a Canadian visa office or, in some cases, directly at a port of entry to Canada
Once the LMIA and CAQ have been obtained by the University, they are sent to the individual in .pdf format. Individuals who are citizens of countries that require a
(TRV) in addition to the work permit must submit their work permit applications directly to either: (1) the Canadian visa office that serves their country of citizenship or to (2) the
in their current country of residence. Each visa office maintains a web site that provides application instructions and requirements and many provide instructions for submitting the Work Permit application via nearby Visa Application Centre (VAC) which work together with the visa office. The individual should be prepared to pay the fees for the work permit as well as those for any other travel documents that may be required and the VAC service fees. Additionally, individuals who have resided for more than six months in certain Canadian government-designated countries will need to undergo an . The visa office will issue a letter of authorization that activates the issuance of the work permit upon entry to Canada.
Processing times at visa offices vary. Applications will take longer to process if a medical examination is required, if there are criminal or security problems, if the individual is applying from a country where he/she does not hold citizenship or permanent resident status. In the last instance, the local visa office might need to consult with other Citizenship and Immigration offices in Canada or abroad.
Individuals who do not require a TRV may apply for their work permit(s) upon arrival at the port of entry to Canada (POE), and should have the following documents on hand:
original signed Concordia University contract
letter of offer
Certificat d'acceptation du Québec (CAQ) issued by the Ministère de l'Immigration et des Communautés culturelles (MIDI)
Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) letter duly signed by Service Canada and the MIDI
Obtain the
(eTA) if visiting or transiting Canada by air as of March 15, 2016  (U.S. citizens are exempt)
updated curriculum vitae
proof of educational qualifications: original or certified copy of terminal degree
valid passport
marriage certificate (if applicable)
children’s birth certificate(s), if applicable
*$155 CDN per work permit requested; $100 per open spousal work permit holder; $125 CDN for each study permit requested. The fee is payable in Canadian currency or Visa or Mastercard. Not all POEs accept payment by debit card. Personal cheques are not accepted.
Individuals in common-law relationships must complete a
form and have the listed documentary evidence.
The best time for an individual to arrive at a POE is during business hours, Monday to Friday. If there is a problem at the POE, the individual should call the Faculty Relations Officer at (514) 848-2424, extension 3680 while still with the immigration agent. Individuals travelling by vehicle should, if possible, try to avoid crossing the border on weekends or at night. It is recommended that individuals verify that the information on their work permit is correct, including the name of the Employer (Concordia University), the job title (e.g. “University Professor” or “Post-secondary Teaching Assistant” in the case of Researchers), as well as any personal information. It can take four to five months to correct any errors on work permits and an incorrect work permit may delay receipt of salary.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), university professors who are citizens of either the United States or Mexico may acquire their initial work permit directly at a port of entry to Canada and do not require either a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Service Canada or a Certificat d’acceptation du Québec (CAQ) from Québec Immigration. Under the NAFTA, work permits are typically issued for no longer than a 36-month period.
Before the port of entry work permit application is made, Concordia University will need to submit the details of the Offer of Employment directly to Citizenship and Immigration Canada via an Employer Portal and pay the $230 Employer Compliance fee online.  This process generates a unique Offer of Employment Number for the position.
Upon arrival at the port of entry to Canada, the individual should have the following documents on hand to show Canadian Immigration:
Offer of Employment Number and $230 Employer Compliance fee receipt
original signed Concordia University contract
letter of offer
updated curriculum vitæ
Obtain the

It is recommended that individuals verify that the information on their work permit is correct, including the name of the Employer (Concordia University), the job title (e.g. “University Professor” or “Post-secondary Teaching Assistant” in the case of Researchers), as well as any personal information as it is easier to have any errors corrected by the immigration agent directly at the port of entry. It can take four to five months to correct any errors on work permits and an incorrect work permit may delay receipt of salary.
Spouses of full-time faculty are allowed to obtain an "open" spousal work permit without having to acquire a Labour Market Impact Assessment or a specific job offer before entering Canada. The cost of a spousal work permit is *$155 CDN and it is "open" in that the permit is not restricted to a specific employer or to a specific occupation. A new regulation introduces a $100 fee on open work permits, in addition to the $155 work permit processing fee, for a total of $255.
If the spouse is a citizen of a country for which a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) is required, then the work permit applications for both the full-time faculty member and the spouse should be submitted to a Canadian visa office . If a TRV is not required, the spousal work permit may be obtained directly at the port of entry to Canada. In the latter case, the couple will need to have a copy of their marriage certificate on hand or a completed
and evidence of this union as indicated on the form. If the spouse intends to work as a primary or secondary school teacher, or in the health services or child care fields, then he/she will need to pass an immigration medical exam before commencing employment.
Important Note: If the spouse does not intend to work in Canada, then he/she must be indicated on the full-time faculty member’s work permit as an accompanying family member, otherwise he/she will be ineligible for Québec health insurance coverage. All dependent children who do not possess a study permit should also be indicated on the principal work permit for the same reason.
A Guest Lecturer is defined as a person invited by a post-secondary institution to give a series of lectures and whose position in the University is temporary and non-continuing. Guest lecturer appointments are validation (LMIA and CAQ) exempt. Appointments of more than five days require a work permit. All
must also obtain temporary resident visas to enter Canada or the
(eTA) when travelling by air.
Visiting scholars, self-funded researchers, and post-doctoral fellows are exempt from having to acquire a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) and certificat d’acceptation du Québec (CAQ). While these appointments are validation exempt, a work permit and the compliance form/fees are still required. All
must also obtain temporary resident visas to enter Canada.
Work permit and Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) applications must be submitted to either: (1) the Canadian visa office that serves the applicant’s country of citizenship or to (2) the Canadian visa office in his/her current country of residence. The individual should be prepared to pay the fees for the work permit as well as any other travel documents that may be required. Additionally, individuals who have resided for more than six months in certain Canadian government-designated countries will need to undergo a medical examination. The visa office will often issue a letter of authorization that activates the issuance of the work permit upon entry to Canada.
Visiting scholars and self-funded researchers should get a letter from their current employer that states the date on which the individual is expected to return to work. This reinforces the temporary nature of the stay in Canada.
Individuals who do not need a TRV may apply for their work permit directly at the port of entry (POE).
Upon arrival at the POE, the following documents should be readily available to show Canadian Immigration:
original signed Concordia University contract and/or letter of offer from Concordia University
letter from current employer that confirms anticipated return to work date
obtain the
(eTA) if visiting or transiting Canada by air – U.S. citizens are exempt
updated curriculum vitae
proof of educational qualifications: original or certified copy of terminal degree (note: Post-doctoral fellows must have proof of PhD)
valid passport
marriage certificate (if applicable)
children’s birth certificate(s), if applicable
*$155 CDN per work permit requested; $100 per open spousal work permit holder;  $150 CDN for each study permit requested. The fee is payable in Canadian currency or Visa or Mastercard. Not all POEs accept payment by debit card. Personal cheques are not accepted.
NOTE: Individuals holding contracts for a period of greater than six (6) months are eligible to apply to the Régie de l’assurance de maladie du Québec (RAMQ) for health insurance coverage. Individuals holding contracts for less than six months are not entitled to Québec or Concordia University health benefits and should make appropriate health insurance arrangements before departing for Montréal.
Children attending Kindergarten (maternelle) who are five years old or younger do not need study permits. Students at all other levels (primary, secondary, college-level or university) as well as individuals who wish to take adult-education courses must acquire a CAQ (Certificat d’acceptation du Québec). Details are available on the
Once the CAQ has been issued, the application for a
must be processed by Citizenship and Immigration Canada. The cost of a study permit is *$150 CDN.
Individuals who are legally entitled to enter the United States and are visa-exempt may go directly to a port of entry such as the Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle land border crossing to get their work and study permits renewed. Any family members holding permits must accompany the principal applicant to the border. Note that the port of entry is not obligated to process renewals – they may instead insist that the renewal application be submitted online or by paper application to the Case Processing Centre in Vegreville Alberta.
Individuals who need renewals of their CAQs and LMIAs must start the work permit renewal process five months in advance of the expiration date of their current work permit. It can take 12 to 16 weeks to get these documents and processing times at the Citizenship and Immigration Canada Case Processing Centre in Vegreville, Alberta vary according to the time of year. During summer months, it may take over 120 working days before applications can be processed (even after issuance of the LMIA/CAQ).
The LMIA renewal request is treated as a new request by Service Canada. Concordia must demonstrate the benefits that the faculty member has made to the University and the community. The faculty member must prepare and send the following documents to :
a statement of accomplishments since the date of hire, highlighting research funding received, external collaborations, events where the faculty member has represented Concordia University, lists of individuals that have been hired or trained (noting in particular all Québecers or Canadians hired).
updated curriculum vitæ
copy of the faculty member’s two most current pay stub (printouts from the Concordia portal are acceptable)
The individual must prepare and send the CAQ application directly to the Faculty Relations Officer with the following required supporting documents. Please note that the faculty member is responsible for the entire *$386 processing fee payment:
completed
copy of the Concordia University contract renewal letter and acceptance of the renewal offer
updated curriculum vitae
*$386 fee payment. This fee may  be paid by
(Visa, MasterCard or American Express) or by other payment methods
The CAQ application and other supporting documents and fees need to be sent to the Faculty Relations Officer at least four months before the expiration date of the current work permit.
Individuals must present their new work permit to Service Canada in order to have their social insurance number renewed. Copies of the confirmation of SIN renewal and new work permit should be sent to Payroll and to the
at GM 806.05.
Individuals who are exempt from LMIA/CAQ still require the compliance form to renew their work permit.
