Aramark, Quebec Menu Program Honored for Health and Sustainability
Aramark in Québec won a first prize at the prestigious DUX gala last month in Montreal.
The Aramark Québec team was awarded under the Menu Development category for large organizations. Candidates in each category were judged by a jury of professionals and influential experts in food and health. The menu program initiatied and monitored by Aramark registered dietitian, Marie-Chantal Lamothe, was recognized for its diversity, quality and attention to healthy lifestyle choices as well as its contribution to sustainable development.
Late in 2015, the Aramark team went through a rigorous process in order to become, in 2016, the first food service organization certified participant of the Aliments du Québec au menu Program. This requires a commitment to ensure that locally sourced meals on the menu are comprised of at least 60% localy sourced ingredients.
DUX is latin for leader and the DUX "Eat Better, Live Better" contest recognizes Québec-based top food supply leaders that have shown a significant commitment to providing customers and consumers with improved food choices and the promotion of healthier lifestyles.
