At the CSU, we actively create and support a vibrant sustainability culture on campus.
Student Sustainability Groups on Campus
All Fee Levy Groups are marked with a heart symbol ♡♡ Sustainable Concordia
We at Sustainable Concordia believe that universities have a crucial role to play in developing an ecologically aware, socially just, and economically responsible society. Our mission is based on the understanding that problem-solving is most fruitful and effective when students, staff, and faculty work together, using a multi stakeholder approach. Sustainable Concordia is a nexus that engages our community to work together in non-hierarchical, consensus based decision-making processes to address issues surrounding climate justice, waste-reduction, and the promotion of sustainable transportation. Come visit us for resources, information, tools, and support for initiating your own project that promotes a more sustainable university!

♡ Sustainability Action Fund (SAF)
SAF was founded in 2007 to help fund projects that contribute towards making Concordia University one of the most sustainable campuses in Canada. Since its inception, it has awarded over $400,000 to help do that, funding projects as diverse as banning bottled water on campus, sustaining the Greenhouse through its formative years, supporting a shift in Concordia’s food system, and supporting sustainable business initiatives. SAF is at the heart of incredibly diverse efforts that all come together on a single point: helping to make Concordia sustainable, in the hopes that our local effects can reverberate across the province, country, and world.

♡ The Concordia Food Coalition
Concordia Food Coalition (CFC) is a group concerned about the economic, ecological, and social implications of the food system at Concordia University. At the CFC, we bring together students, faculty and staff to promote and facilitate a transition to a more sustainable food system in collaboration with organizations at Concordia and beyond. Our aim is to foster a community- centered food system that will begin at Concordia University, but that will be built with expansion in mind. Please contact us to get involved in the food movement happening at Concordia!

♡ The Concordia Greenhouse
Located in a rooftop greenhouse at the top of the Hall building, downtown (take the stairs from the 12th floor!), the Greenhouse is a badly needed oasis of sun, warmth, plants, and the intoxicating smell of life going about its business. It provides a gorgeous atrium for students to relax, work, and socialize, as well as multiple rooms housing projects ranging from a Tea Garden, to a full scale Aquaponics system. Their annual seedling sale is also a mainstay of Montreal’s urban farmers, and goes a long way towards promoting local food production right here among our own student body! The Greenhouse also runs an annual City Farm School, which offers participants an intensive 8 month internship and workshops in Urban Farming in Montreal. Drop in anytime to learn, to relax, to get involved, or just to see how beautiful Montreal is from inside a greenhouse 13 stories off the ground.

The primary goal of this project is to respond to a growing interest in issues around food sovereignty, beekeeping,  and the practice of urban agriculture as well as to provide an opportunity for students and community to collaborate. See our website for ways to get involved!

The program was formed as a response to the needs of community groups for concrete research, but who are lacking the resources to produce it themselves. Students can complete a CURE research project as part of their coursework or as an independent project that allows students to link their academic research with the work of community groups and activist organizations.
