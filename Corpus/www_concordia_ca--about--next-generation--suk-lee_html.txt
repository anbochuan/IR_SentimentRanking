MY NAME IS
JIN SUK LEE
I’m studying plant science to create an agricultural revolution.
Climate change is creating new challenges in agriculture, meaning we need to find new ways to produce greener crops.
I am studying the molecular mechanism behind plant growth and development, to engineer a future with more sustainable crops that give higher yields. This is key in a country like Canada, where agriculture is our single biggest industry.
My name is Jin Suk Lee, and I’m the Concordia University Research Chair in Plant Science and Biotechnology.
