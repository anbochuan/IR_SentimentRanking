Why pursue a Master's in Religions and Cultures?
The world today is increasingly aware of and responsive to the diversity in religions and cultures. The Department of Religions and Cultures offers an exceptional environment for graduate studies. Strong mentoring and a collegial environment are hallmarks of our program.
The Master’s in Religious and Cultures will provide you with the opportunity to explore how religion interacts within this globalized world. This program has been revamped and rethought, with an eye to students’ needs.  Our broad spectrum of seminars will give you the means to examine a variety of religious traditions, and discover emerging subspecialties based on your research interests.  The inter-disciplinarity of our program and research expertise of our acclaimed faculty members spans multiple traditions and fields of study.
The cultural moment in Montreal, and Quebec more broadly, is in intense discussion with its religious past, and with the meaning of diversity in a province with a particular identity and political history.  The Department of Religions and Cultures is an exemplary place to study such developments, as well as to attain skills that will aid students in seeking meaningful involvement in the wider society and workplace.
