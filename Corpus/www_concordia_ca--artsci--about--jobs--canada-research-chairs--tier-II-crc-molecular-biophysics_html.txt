Tier II Canada Research Chair in Molecular Biophysics in Human Health
Note: application deadline has been extended to November 22, 2017.
Concordia University seeks to appoint a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair (CRC), a research intensive faculty position, in Molecular Biophysics in Human Health. The selected candidate will receive a joint tenure-track faculty appointment as a full-member of both the Department of Physics and the Department of Biology in the Faculty of Arts and Science. The ideal candidate will have experience with multidisciplinary research involving biophysics and health science, an outstanding publication record and experience in areas including, but not limited to biophysics, biology, and physics.
Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, which is a diverse and culturally rich city, offering a high quality of life in North America. The Department of Physics has strengths in human health bio-imaging, and in plant molecular biophysics. The Department of Biology has substantial research strengths in genomics, synthetic biology, bioinformatics and cell & molecular biology, all of which contribute to human health research.
Qualified candidates will have a PhD in Biophysics, Biology, Physics or an equivalent field, and relevant postdoctoral experience. The selected candidate will be expected to develop a strong independent research program, secure significant external funding and establish collaborations with Concordia research centers such as the PERFORM Centre, which is a multidisciplinary health research center interested in further developing its biophysics research, the CMCI Centre for Microscopy and Cellular Imaging, CERMM Centre for Research in Molecular Modeling, or CASB Center for Applied Synthetic Biology. They are expected to position Concordia to be an emerging leader in biophysics and its application to critical issues in health, physics, and biology. The candidate will be expected to teach in both the Departments of Biology and Physics.
About the Canada Research Chair Program
The  is a national strategy that invests approximately $265 million per year to attract and retain the world’s most accomplished and promising minds.
