Sushil K. Misra received his Ph. D. degree in Physics from St. Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA in the area of condensed matter physics. He did his post-doctoral work at the University of Toronto. His current research interests are in both theoretical and experimental EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance, also known as ESR, electron spin resonance). His research laboratory includes X-band (~9.5 GHz) and Q-band (~35 GHz) CW (continuous wave) EPR spectrometers, operational in the 4.2 – 1000 K temperature range.
He collaborates actively with researchers at ACERT (Advanced Center for Electron Spin Resonance Technology) at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, whose director is Professor Jack Freed, as a collaborating faculty member from Canada. Apart from single-crystal and polycrystalline CW EPR research using the 170 and 240 GHz at ACERT, he does simulations for rigorous computations of signals obtained (i) by DQC (double quantum coherence) pulsed EPR to measure distances in membranes, and (ii) by 2D-ELDOR (two dimensional electron double resonance) pulsed EPR to measure distances in biological samples at ambient temperatures.
His other involvement is in optimizing the coil gradients used in the EPR imaging being developed at ACERT. He is also carrying out EPR research in nano-materials and high-Tc superconductors. He has also been involved in electron spin-lattice relaxation studies, with the latest research being on exploitation of amplitude-modulation technique in measuring very short spin-lattice (T1) and electron-electron (T2) relaxation times, in the range of one-tenth nano-second to one micro-second. Nine Ph. D. and ten Master?s students have received their degrees under his supervision
He has served as an external examiner to several Ph. D. theses examinations outside of Concordia University, submitted in Canada, France, and Australia. He serves as a referee to important journals in Physics and Chemistry which publish EPR research, e.g. the Physical Review and Physical Review Letters, Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, Journal of Chemical Physics, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Magnetism and magnetic Materials, Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Journal of Applied Magnetic Resonance. He has published several review articles in EPR, as well as he has written book chapters in leading research monographs. His research has been continuously supported by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada). Of the over 200 papers published by him in refereed journals, over 150 are in the field of EPR.
