Our community is made ​​up of over 200 affiliates. Academic and community-based researchers, students, artists, educators, and practitioners specializing in different disciplines: their diverse areas of expertise are impressive.
Ethical guidelines, practical and methodological training, webinars, digital tools, software and links: this section contains a variety of useful tools for anyone wishing to develop an oral history project.
Our affiliates continuously produce a wide variety of research and multimedia projects. Here you will find information on current and past projects, as well as on the many outcomes produced by our community.
Our archives contain thousands of oral history interviews recorded by our affiliated researchers and partners. These documents can be consulted by researchers and the public. We also accept donations of oral history interviews.
Thursday, November 23, from 12PM to 2PM
With Piyusha Chatterjee
Sharing authority is a key tenet of oral history practice and one of the ways oral historians deal with it is through negotiating consent to record and use the interviews for research and to go public. What is this process of negotiation and how does different socio-political, economic and cultural contexts complicate this process? This workshop will be a reflection on the complexities of aligning institutional ethics requirements with personal ethics and ethics on the field. And it is likely that we will go back from this workshop with more questions on our minds than answers, for muddying the waters – when it comes to ethics – is one step closer to sharing authority.
