Dr.
Arshad-Ayaz is a post-colonial critical theorist. She has taught for
universities in Pakistan (Humdard University), Canada (McGill
University, Bishops University, University of Regina and Concordia
University) and the United Kingdom (external program University of
London, London School of Economics (LSE).
Dr.
Arshad-Ayaz’s research and teaching practice draws from a number of
theoretical traditions, including critical theory, critical pedagogy,
feminist theory, post-colonial, and other global discourses.
Her
previous anthropological background and work experience directs her
analyses to focus on the social, cultural, historical, political and
economic dynamics of a particular context that affect teaching and
learning. In the area of comparative and international education her
research demonstrates the importance of context in providing an
understanding of not what works in education but what works under what context.
Dr.
Arshad-Ayaz’s published work explores education policies and programs
especially those related to the introduction of educational technology
in Pakistan and other developing countries.  Dr.
Arshad-Ayaz has also published on the impact of globalization on
education policies and practices in North American and European
context.
