Beware of e-mail scams

Fraud: Recognize it. Report it. Stop it.
In your search for an apartment, a sub-letter, a roommate and a housemate beware of email sublet scams! Always trust your instincts if something seems too good to be true. While the details of any scam can vary, many scams in recent years have shared the following characteristics:
The interested "renter" responds very quickly to your ad.
He doesn't ask to see pictures, nor does he ask any questions about move-in dates -- he seems extremely accommodating.
He tell you a long story about his life, how good of a person he/she is, no smoking etc
He will offer money right away in the form of a (fraudulent) MONEY ORDER, MONEYGRAM, or BANK DRAFT, but will send more than the required amount.
The bank will hold the money order (or other form of payment) for 5 days, but the sub-letter will pressure you to wire-transfer the balance in the meantime. He might claim they accidentally overpaid and that they urgently need you to return the extra amount. Common reasons are “my boss owes me money,” or “I need it for my plane ticket to Montreal.” DO NOT give them any money out of your own pocket.
The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre has information on SCAM TYPES, HAVE BEEN SCAMMED SAMPLES, SCAM FORUM, HOW TO REPORT A FRAUD and much more of their website .

Examples of scam emails that renters received in the past of couple of months.
Example 1
Thanks for getting back to me about the place I was starting to worry about not finding place in time. I will start by telling you about myself. Again I’m Brooke Harris and I'm 25 years old, one younger sibling with whom I am very close.I finished my BA in Foreign language and I am coming for some professional exams. I love meeting and getting to know new people.I am social, easy to get along with, goal driven, hard working, and personable. I cook, clean, keep organized, and can fix almost anything after working by my architect father for 15 plus years. I’m respectful to everyone and demand the same respect in return. Respect is a big deal to me; especially between roommates.
My job and lifestyle often keep me busy and awake late in the night but if you are sleeping or need quiet I have no problem abiding. I do drink socially and I don't smoke and I respect that you do and wont bother you with my habits. My family has lived in Northern Virginia for over 40 years and I have lived here all my life.
My father owns a bathroom hardware construction company and his philosophies and teachings greatly shaped my personality. My mother was a Nurse. At the moment she is not feeling too fine and she has stopped working and taking a lot of rest, I know she will get better soon though.. I plan on receiving my masters in Foreign language after studying a professional course and I am willing to put in the effort necessary for my masters. I enjoy partying once in a while and having fun but I understand that school is my number one priority. I will be expecting your email to know if the place is still open. I am presently doing my  internship in San Francisco Bay.
we can only send emails and get email back some times. I will let my parent know at once to know if they can mail the payment to you to help me hold up the place for a couple of days until my  arrival and I hoping to hear from you real soon.
As for the apartment, I will like to know the monthly rent and the security deposit if needed and also to confirm if the lease is a full year lease. I do not like to know what items are need for the apartment as well as furniture (couches, beds, dressers,tables, desks) and appliances (stove, fridge, oven, microwave, and a large TV). I like to move into the place by this month ending.
I will also like to get details of the questions below.
1. I will like to have the description of the place, size, and the equipment in there.
2. I will like to have the rent fee per month plus the utilities .
3. Also I will like to know if there is any garage or parking space cos I am already making arrangement for a car before I get home.
4. I will also like to know if I can make an advance payment ahead my arrival that will be stand as a kind of commitment that I am truly coming over to rent the place which will also serve as a collateral for you to hold the place for me, upon my arrival to move in.
5. If the #4 questions am going ask is YES, I will like to know the total cost for me to pay for 2 months rent including utilities, before I move in, something like a deposit or something to guarantee me the place prior to me arrival.
6. I will like to know the major intersection nearest your neighborhood like shopping mall, bus line etc
NOTE:If there will be any form to fill I wont be able to fill out the application form until the first day of my arrival. Hope this is OK by you email me to also let me know.
I await your response and any questions you may have thanks once again.
Example 2
I am very interested in renting your place. I am from Vänersborg, Sweden and been living there for the past 10years and I'm 26years old. I rarely drink and don't smoke. love pets but will be coming with none. I'm very laidback,responsible,respectful and the most important thing to me at this moment of forging ahead in my career(after family). I'm quite open minded and never hold bigoted views against others inclinations.
Also, I'm coming to resume work as a IT Infrastructure Analyst for the next 3years and can rent your place on short term basis or long term but the lest period of intended stay in your place is three months and a maximum of 1 year. I will like to know when your place is available to move into, I'm quite flexible to duration of availability.
I look forward to your positive response
Have a bright day.

Thanks so much for your mail but i think there is a little mis understanding, i was intrested in the sublet and not lease the place seems okay by me, also i am okay with the  price and the locational advantage.I really hope you will grant me the priviledge for my daughter to meet you.I would like to have the room for 2 months.I will like you to know that she will be coming in as soon as i have secured a suitable place to for her to stay in.I would really love her to be in the home..
This is a little more about FELICIA PURNER MY DAUGHTER...SHE IS FELICIA PURNER presently based in UK. .she is 24 years of age.she is very nice, caring honest,kind responsible hardworking ,clean,reliable and social.she like watching movies swimming and running and reading too she does not go to partys ,smoke nor drink she is very passionate and also like to share ideas with others.
Concerning payment, I have contacted my client and he promised will make out payment to you,he will be paying you in excess, cos he's taking care of her accomodation and travelling fee.
As soon as you get the Cheque,get it deposited in your bank.When it gets cleared,pls deduct the cost fo the room for 2 months,INCLUDING ALL THE BILLS and send the remaining balance, which would be for her flight expenses and her living allowance for the short period,The balance should be sent to her travelling agent whose information i would give to you as soon as you recieve payment.
I want you to see this as a favour you'll be willing to do for me. As soon as she get there,she will make preparations for the remaining months,including all bills. Pls i want you to do this for me in good faith. if you comply,do not hesitate to provide me with these information.

Example 5
Hey,
We didn't plan it this way,in the first palce you didn't even inform me you are giving the place out after we have agreed that i have the place,now you went and drop my payment with the housing authority how do you want to pay for my travel ticket and doother stuff down here,it's very unfair and selfish of
you coz it's like you only care about yourself and no other person,i can understand you have exams to worry about but is it the 10mins it will take you to cash the money from your bank and probably the five mins you will spend at a western union location that you can't sacrifice,i guess it will amke you fulfilled if
you jeopardise my travel arrangement.
Just go the office and get the payment and do as i have instructed in my earlier emails,i know you will be human enough to do this.

I am really comfortable renting from someone who cares like yourself.Thanks for the love,concern and efforts for me via email.

Western Union is preferred, it is fast, reliable and convenient.The traveling agent will be collecting the money within 5 minutes after the transaction is completed at your end.Have you sent money via western union before? if you have not, feel free to tell me and I can tell you the procedure.I will email you my flight details after the booking is done.I can't wait to me you soon.This is the Traveling Agent  information you needed for the transfer below.

Are you the landlord or tenant, lease consultant or you are subletting it? I can live with friendly pets, though I have none and not planning to have one.
I will be sending you some of my necessary documents in the subsequent mails. Get back to me on the accommodation that is available for rent.
