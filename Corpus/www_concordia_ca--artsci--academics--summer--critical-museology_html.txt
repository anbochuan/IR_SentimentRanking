FIELD SCHOOL IN CRITICAL MUSEOLOGYHow can museums enhance democracy, belonging, and dialogue about national and global heritage?
May 15–27, 2017
This field school exposes students to the most current approaches to "critical museology" theory via discussion of decolonizing approaches, human rights and social justice mandates, and the ways that museum architecture, digital technologies, and forms of implicit and explicit pedagogy allow or inhibit encounters with "difficult knowledge."
Students benefit from a curriculum developed by leading experts in the field, complemented with guided “behind the scenes” field-study visits to Montreal museums, to address current issues, challenges, and areas of innovation in the rapidly changing world of museums.
Hosted at Concordia's , participants join an international network of peers to learn, debate, and design their own “curatorial dream” to present to an international, specialist audience during the  conference at the end of the course.
While the course is now over, you can still peruse blogs, photos and other materials:
Meet the students.
Students from around the world participated in the Critical Museology summer field school. Here you will find their biographies and materials produced during the course, including blog posts and conference posters.
