Why study Mathematics and Statistics?
Mathematics is a language that answers real-world questions in science and engineering. Statistics is the science of information. Studying them together gives you a set of tools which will allow you to explore the meaning behind the numbers in a range of practical applications.
This program is designed for students who wish to enter the job market right after graduation. As a Mathematics and Statistics student, you’ll uncover the mathematical structure of random systems such as the economy and the stock market, health and survival, and weather forecasting.  You will build a solid foundation in linear algebra, calculus, probability and number theory, and learn to use professional software tools for mathematics and data analysis applications.
If you choose the Joint Major with Computer Applications, you’ll complement your mathematics knowledge with computer science topics such as modelling and symbolic computation. It’s also common for Mathematics and Statistics students to add a minor in a different field of their choice.
After you graduate with a Major in Mathematics and Statistics, you will have the knowledge and skills required to apply mathematics and statistics in professional careers in business, industry or government agencies.
Program Details
A Bachelor of Arts or Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, .
Concentrations:
Major in Mathematics and Statistics (42 credits)
(78 credits)
Minor in Mathematics and Statistics (24 credits)
About the Major
The Major in Mathematics & Statistics is a 42-credit program with a common core of 36 credits. It is aimed at students who would like to have a good background in the mathematical sciences, but whose goals are to enter the job market upon graduation, rather than to pursue graduate studies. The focus of the Major is on the applicable nature of the mathematical sciences as tools for solving, and as ways of thinking about, a wide range of problems. Certain selected topics will be covered in each course accompanied by the use of appropriate software applications.
