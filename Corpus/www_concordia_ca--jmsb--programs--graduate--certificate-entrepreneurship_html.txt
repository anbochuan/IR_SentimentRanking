Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship
Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship
Get the skills and know-how to work for yourself
From artists to psychologists, from graphic designers to freelance writers, over 15% of the Canadian workforce is self-employed.
The Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship (GCE) is a short, focused, graduate-level business program that provides students from various backgrounds with the critical skills and knowledge they need to plan, launch and sustain their own micro-enterprise.
This unique 15-credit program can be completed on a part-time or full-time basis, and is designed specifically for non-business students wishing to start their own micro-enterprise such as an artist-run studio, design firm, or professional practice.
Why the GCE?
You will learn:
• The essentials of self-employment and management of a micro-enterprise
• Marketing basics: how to develop the marketing plan for your venture
• How to develop your business plan
• To anticipate and understand the issues that will arise as your business grows
Who is the GCE for?
The program is for recent university graduates with a bachelor’s degree in any non-business discipline, as well as professionals and artists looking to start their own business. Participants must be Canadians or permanent residents.
No prior work experience is required.
